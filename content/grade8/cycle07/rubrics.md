## Week 1 Rubrics: Evidence of Chemical Reactions

### Station 1: Reaction Evidence Lab
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** List the five types of evidence for chemical reactions and give an example of each.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | All 5 types + examples + molecular explanation | "1) Color change (phenolphthalein turns pink in base—indicator reacts to form new molecule). 2) Gas production (baking soda + vinegar makes CO₂ bubbles). 3) Temperature change (calcium chloride + water releases heat). 4) Precipitate (clear solutions form solid). 5) Light production (glow sticks emit light as chemicals react). All involve atoms rearranging into new substances." |
| **3** | All 5 types + examples | "Color change, gas bubbles, temperature change, solid forming, light. Example: vinegar and baking soda makes bubbles." |
| **2** | 3-4 types | "Color change, bubbles, and getting hot." |
| **1** | 1-2 types or major errors | "Things change color." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Mass Conservation Investigation
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** Explain why mass appears to be lost when you burn a piece of paper, but isn't actually lost.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Conservation + gas escape + sealed system proof | "Mass ISN'T actually lost—it just seems that way because the products are gases (CO₂ and H₂O vapor) that escape into the air. If you burned paper in a sealed container, the mass before and after would be exactly the same. All the atoms in the paper are still there, just rearranged into gas molecules that we can't see. Conservation of mass means atoms can't be created or destroyed." |
| **3** | Conservation + gas escape | "The mass becomes gas that floats away. If it was sealed, the mass would be the same." |
| **2** | Partial understanding | "Some of it turns into gas." |
| **1** | Major misconception | "The fire burns up the atoms." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Reaction Detector Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS1.A | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** Design a chemical indicator to detect when food has spoiled. Explain your design.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Evidence type + mechanism + practical design | "Use a pH indicator dye printed on the packaging. When food spoils, bacteria produce acids that lower pH. The dye changes from green (fresh, neutral pH) to red (spoiled, acidic pH). The indicator is separated from food by a semi-permeable membrane that lets gases through but keeps dye out of food. Consumer sees color change and knows not to eat." |
| **4** | Evidence type + design | "Use pH paper that changes color when acid is produced by spoiling." |
| **3** | Evidence type + partial design | "Use something that changes color when food goes bad." |
| **2** | Design without chemistry | "Put a sensor in the food." |
| **1** | Impractical design | "Smell it to see if it's bad." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Reaction Types & Conservation

### Station 1: Reaction Type Classification
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Classify this reaction and explain your reasoning: 2Na + Cl₂ → 2NaCl

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct type + pattern reasoning + product analysis | "This is a SYNTHESIS reaction. Two simpler substances (sodium metal and chlorine gas) combine to form one more complex compound (sodium chloride = table salt). The pattern is A + B → AB. We can tell because two reactants become one product, and the product contains elements from both reactants combined together." |
| **3** | Correct type + reasoning | "Synthesis because two things combine into one compound." |
| **2** | Correct type only | "Synthesis reaction." |
| **1** | Incorrect classification | "This is decomposition." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Balancing Equations Lab
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** Balance this equation and explain what balancing proves about atoms: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly balanced + conservation explanation | "4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃. Left side: 4 iron atoms, 6 oxygen atoms. Right side: 4 iron atoms (2 × 2), 6 oxygen atoms (2 × 3). Balancing proves that atoms are CONSERVED—the same atoms that start in the reactants end up in the products, just rearranged. No atoms are created or destroyed, which is the law of conservation of mass." |
| **3** | Correctly balanced + partial explanation | "4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃. Same atoms on both sides means mass is conserved." |
| **2** | Correctly balanced only | "4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃" |
| **1** | Incorrect balancing | "Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃ is already balanced." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Chemical Process Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Systems

**Question:** Design a process to remove dissolved silver ions from water using a precipitation reaction.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Reaction + equation + practical process | "Add sodium chloride (NaCl) solution to the silver-contaminated water. This causes a double replacement reaction: AgNO₃ + NaCl → AgCl + NaNO₃. Silver chloride (AgCl) is insoluble, so it precipitates as a white solid. Then filter the water to remove the solid silver chloride. The silver is now in the filter, and the water is clean. This works because Ag⁺ and Cl⁻ form an insoluble compound." |
| **4** | Reaction + equation | "Add chloride to make silver chloride precipitate: Ag⁺ + Cl⁻ → AgCl. Then filter it out." |
| **3** | Reaction concept | "Add something that makes silver form a solid, then filter." |
| **2** | Vague answer | "Remove it with a chemical." |
| **1** | Impractical design | "Boil away the water." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 3 Rubrics: Synthesis & Assessment

### Synthesis Question
**Question:** A student burns 5 grams of magnesium in air and ends up with 8 grams of ash. Did this violate conservation of mass? Explain.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | No violation + oxygen explanation + equation | "NO, this doesn't violate conservation of mass. The magnesium reacted with oxygen from the AIR: 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO. The extra 3 grams came from oxygen gas that combined with the magnesium. If we weighed the air before and after, we'd find it lost 3 grams of oxygen. Total mass of system (magnesium + air) stayed the same. This actually proves conservation—atoms from the air joined the solid." |
| **4** | No violation + oxygen explanation | "No violation. Oxygen from the air added to the magnesium, making the product heavier." |
| **3** | No violation + partial explanation | "No, because something from the air combined with it." |
| **2** | Uncertain answer | "Maybe because of oxygen?" |
| **1** | Incorrect—thinks mass was created | "Yes, mass was created in the reaction." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Quick Reference: Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Probing Question |

| "Atoms are destroyed" | Atoms rearrange, never destroyed | "Count the atoms on each side" |
| "Reactions need heat" | Many occur at room temperature | "What about glow sticks?" |

## Overview

This cycle explores chemical reactions at the macroscopic and molecular levels, emphasizing evidence for reactions and the conservation of mass. Students investigate the signs of chemical change, distinguish between chemical and physical changes, and develop the foundational understanding that atoms are rearranged—not created or destroyed—during reactions.

## Driving Phenomena

| Week | Phenomenon | Driving Question |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Week 1 | Glow sticks fade over time | "Why do glow sticks eventually stop glowing?" |
| Week 2 | Two clear liquids form a solid | "How can mixing two clear liquids make something solid appear?" |
| Week 3 | Synthesis & Assessment | Integrated understanding of chemical reactions |

---

## Standards Alignment

### Primary Standard
- **MS-PS1-2:** Analyze and interpret data on the properties of substances before and after the substances interact to determine if a chemical reaction has occurred.

### Spiral Standards
| Code | Description | From Cycle | Integration Point |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| MS-PS2-3 | Electric and magnetic forces | Cycle 6 | Energy transformation in reactions |
| MS-PS4-2 | Wave interactions with matter | Cycle 5 | Light emission in chemiluminescence |

## 3D Learning Framework

### Science & Engineering Practices (SEPs)
| Practice | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **SEP-4:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | Analyze before/after properties to identify reactions |
| **SEP-3:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | Design experiments to test for reaction evidence |
| **SEP-6:** Constructing Explanations | Explain reaction mechanisms using evidence |

### Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)
| DCI | Key Concept |
|-----|-------------|
| **PS1.A:** Structure and Properties of Matter | Substances have characteristic properties that identify them |
| **PS1.B:** Chemical Reactions | Atoms rearrange during reactions; total mass is conserved |

### Cross-Cutting Concepts (CCCs)
| CCC | Application |
|-----|-------------|
| **CCC-5:** Energy and Matter | Energy is released or absorbed in reactions; atoms conserved |
| **CCC-1:** Patterns | Reaction types follow predictable patterns |
| **CCC-7:** Stability and Change | Reactions change substances; equilibrium concepts |

## Target Misconceptions

| ID | Misconception | Correct Understanding | Frequency | Targeting Strategy |
|----|---------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| mass-lost-reactions | Mass is lost or gained in chemical reactions | Mass is always conserved; atoms rearrange but aren't created/destroyed | 60% | Sealed container mass measurements |
| chemical-physical-confused | Difficulty distinguishing chemical from physical changes | Chemical changes form new substances; physical changes alter form not composition | 55% | Side-by-side comparisons with evidence |
| reactions-destroy-atoms | Reactions destroy or create atoms | Atoms are conserved; they rearrange into new molecules | 45% | Molecular model building before/after |

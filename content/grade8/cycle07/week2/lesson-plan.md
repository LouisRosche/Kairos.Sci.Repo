# Grade 8 Cycle 7 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Reaction Types & Conservation

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS1-2 (Primary), MS-PS2-3 & MS-PS4-2 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Disappearing Solid Mystery**
Pour one clear liquid into another clear liquid—nothing special, right? But suddenly, a white solid appears out of nowhere! Where did it come from? Both liquids were completely clear, with nothing solid in them. How can combining two liquids create something solid?

**Driving Question:** How can mixing two clear liquids make something solid appear?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Classify reactions into major types (synthesis, decomposition, replacement)
2. Balance simple chemical equations using models
3. Explain how atoms are conserved during reactions
4. Predict products based on reaction type patterns

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What are the five types of evidence for chemical reactions?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Precipitation reaction (two clear solutions → solid)
- **Driving Question:** How can two clear liquids create a solid?
- **Week 1 Connection:** "We saw evidence of reactions. This is precipitate formation—but where do the atoms come from?"
- **Materials:** Lead nitrate + potassium iodide solutions (or simulation)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on Week 1 concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Pour two perfectly clear solutions together
- Bright yellow solid (lead iodide) appears instantly
- Key question: "The solid wasn't in either liquid. Where did it come from?"
- "Today we discover how atoms rearrange to make new substances"

### Station 1: Reaction Type Classification (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Categorize reactions into major types
- **Activity:** Observe/analyze reactions and classify by type
- **Key Vocabulary:** Synthesis, decomposition, single replacement, double replacement, combustion
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy transfer from Cycle 6

**Reaction Types:**
| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Synthesis | A + B → AB | 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O |
| Decomposition | AB → A + B | 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂ |
| Single Replacement | A + BC → AC + B | Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂ |
| Double Replacement | AB + CD → AD + CB | NaCl + AgNO₃ → NaNO₃ + AgCl |
| Combustion | Fuel + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O | CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O |

**Classification Protocol:**
1. Observe reaction or examine equation
2. Count number of reactants and products
3. Identify pattern (combining, breaking apart, swapping)
4. Match to reaction type
5. Verify with periodic table if needed

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Products come from nowhere" | Products made from reactant atoms | Build molecular models |
| "Atoms are destroyed in reactions" | Atoms rearrange; same atoms before and after | Count atoms on both sides |
| "Energy disappearing means mass lost" | Energy and mass are different; mass conserved | Sealed container demonstrations |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Balancing equations and atom conservation
- **Model:** Why equations must be balanced
- **Think-Aloud:** "If I have 2 hydrogen atoms on the left, how many must be on the right?"
- **Visual:** Atom counting with molecular models

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Coefficients show how many molecules
2. Subscripts show atoms in one molecule
3. Same atoms must exist on both sides
4. Balancing = accounting for all atoms

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Name the five reaction types"
- Review balancing concept
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Balancing Equations Lab (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Use physical models to balance chemical equations
- **Activity:** Build molecular models to verify balanced equations
- **Spiral Connection:** Wave-matter interactions from Cycle 5

**Balancing Protocol:**
1. Write unbalanced equation
2. Build molecular models of reactants
3. Rearrange atoms to form products
4. Count atoms on each side
5. Adjust coefficients until balanced
6. Verify: same atoms, same numbers

**Equations to Balance:**
| Unbalanced | Hint | Answer (hidden) |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| H₂ + O₂ → H₂O | Need 2 oxygen atoms | 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O |
| Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃ | Need 4 Fe and 6 O | 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ |
| CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O | Start with carbon | CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O |

**Physical Model Rules:**
- Each ball = one atom
- Connect atoms to show bonds
- Break apart reactant models
- Rebuild as product models
- All balls must be used!

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What happens if equations aren't balanced?
2. Why can't we just add atoms to one side?
3. How does balancing prove conservation of mass?

### Station 3: Design a Chemical Process (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply reaction type knowledge to solve a problem
- **Activity:** Design a process to create a target product
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations) + SEP-3 (Planning Investigations)

**Design Challenge:**
A water treatment plant needs to remove lead ions from contaminated water. Design a chemical process that will precipitate lead out of the water so it can be filtered.

**Design Requirements:**
1. Must use a precipitation (double replacement) reaction
2. Must identify specific reactants needed
3. Product must be a solid that can be filtered
4. Process must be safe and practical

**Design Plan Must Include:**
1. Reaction type and equation
2. Why this reaction works for lead removal
3. Products formed (which is the precipitate?)
4. Safety considerations

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Lead ions react with sulfate, carbonate, or chloride ions to form precipitates
- Example: Pb²⁺ + 2Cl⁻ → PbCl₂ (solid)
- Real water treatment uses similar chemistry
- Connect to environmental science and public health

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (reaction types, balancing equations)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Week 1: evidence; Cycle 6: energy)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect reaction type to conservation)
  - 1 SEP-6 question (Construct explanation for reaction)

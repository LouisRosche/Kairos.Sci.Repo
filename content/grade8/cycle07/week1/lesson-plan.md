## Phenomenon

**The Fading Glow Mystery**
Crack a glow stick and it lights up—no batteries, no electricity, just a bright glow that slowly fades over hours until it's completely dark. What's happening inside? Why does it eventually stop? And why can't you recharge it?

**Driving Question:** Why do glow sticks eventually stop glowing?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Identify five types of evidence for chemical reactions
2. Distinguish between chemical and physical changes
3. Explain that mass is conserved during chemical reactions
4. Design investigations to detect chemical reactions

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What's the difference between atoms and molecules?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Glow stick demonstration + time-lapse video of fading
- **Driving Question:** Why does the glow stick eventually stop glowing?
- **Prior Knowledge Connection:** "We studied energy transformation. Where does the light energy come from?"
- **Materials:** Several glow sticks at different stages, time-lapse video
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on energy concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Crack fresh glow stick—instant bright glow
- Compare to glow stick cracked yesterday (dim)
- Compare to one from a week ago (dark)
- Key question: "What's being 'used up' inside?"
- "Today we discover the chemical reaction that makes light"

### Station 1: Reaction Evidence Lab (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Identify the five types of evidence for chemical reactions
- **Activity:** Observe multiple reactions and categorize evidence types
- **Key Vocabulary:** Chemical reaction, reactant, product, endothermic, exothermic
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy transformation from Cycle 6

**Evidence Categories:**
| Evidence Type | Example Reaction | What to Look For |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Color change | Phenolphthalein + base | Pink color appears |
| Gas production | Baking soda + vinegar | Bubbles/fizzing |
| Temperature change | Calcium chloride + water | Gets hot or cold |
| Precipitate formation | Silver nitrate + salt | Solid appears |
| Light production | Glow stick (chemiluminescence) | Glowing |

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Observe each reaction station (safety glasses required!)
2. Record observations for each evidence type
3. Classify as chemical or physical change
4. Identify reactants and products where possible

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Bubbles always mean chemical reaction" | Some bubbles are physical (boiling) | Compare boiling water vs reaction bubbles |
| "Dissolving is a chemical reaction" | Dissolving is physical; substance unchanged | Evaporate salt water to recover salt |
| "If it looks different, it's chemical" | Must form new substance with new properties | Test properties before and after |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Chemical vs physical changes and conservation of mass
- **Model:** What happens to atoms during a reaction
- **Think-Aloud:** "If no atoms are created or destroyed, where does the mass go?"
- **Visual:** Molecular animation of glow stick reaction

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Chemical reactions rearrange atoms into new molecules
2. No atoms are created or destroyed
3. Mass before = mass after (conservation)
4. Energy is released or absorbed (not mass)

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete observation tables
- **Extension:** Research chemiluminescence in nature (fireflies, deep sea fish)
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on reaction concepts

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Name the five types of evidence for chemical reactions"
- Review chemical vs physical changes
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Mass Conservation Investigation (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Quantify that mass is conserved during reactions
- **Activity:** Measure mass before and after reactions in sealed systems
- **Spiral Connection:** Wave energy from Cycle 5 (light emission in reactions)

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Weigh sealed container with reactants separated inside
2. Mix reactants (shake/tilt container)
3. Observe reaction evidence
4. Weigh sealed container after reaction
5. Record and compare masses
6. Repeat with different reaction

**Data Collection:**
| Reaction | Mass Before (g) | Mass After (g) | Difference | Observation |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Baking soda + vinegar (sealed) | ? | ? | ? | Bubbles, cold |
| Steel wool + oxygen (sealed) | ? | ? | ? | Color change, warm |

**Key Discovery:**
- Mass is ALWAYS conserved in sealed system
- Gas production can make it SEEM like mass is lost (open system)
- The atoms are still there, just rearranged

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why do people think things "burn away" and lose mass?
2. If you burned wood in a sealed container, would mass change?
3. How does this connect to the law of conservation of mass?

### Station 3: Design a Reaction Detector (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply reaction evidence knowledge to identification problem
- **Activity:** Design a system to detect if a reaction has occurred
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-3 (Planning Investigations) + SEP-4 (Analyzing Data)

**Design Challenge:**
A food company needs to know if milk has spoiled. Spoiled milk undergoes a chemical reaction that produces lactic acid. Design a detection system that indicates when this reaction has occurred.

**Design Requirements:**
1. Must use at least one type of reaction evidence
2. Must give clear indicator (visible to consumer)
3. Must not contaminate the food
4. Should work over the shelf life of the product

**Design Plan Must Include:**
1. Evidence type used (color change, pH indicator, etc.)
2. How indicator will be incorporated
3. Expected result for fresh vs spoiled
4. Potential limitations

**Facilitation Notes:**
- pH indicators change color with acidity (lactic acid = lower pH)
- Real products use similar technology
- Connect to food safety and chemistry applications

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (reaction evidence, mass conservation)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 6: energy; Cycle 5: light waves)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect energy release to evidence)
  - 1 SEP-4 question (Analyze reaction data)

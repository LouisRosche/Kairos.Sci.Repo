# Grade 8 Cycle 7 Week 3 Lesson Plan
## Synthesis & Assessment

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS1-2 (Primary), MS-PS2-3 & MS-PS4-2 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Focus
Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycles 5-6

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Connect reaction evidence to reaction types
2. Apply conservation of mass to all reaction types
3. Demonstrate understanding of chemical change vs physical change
4. Integrate concepts from Cycles 5-7 in system-level explanations

---

## Day 1: Synthesis & Review

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check
- Overview of Week 3 assessment structure
- "Today we'll connect everything about chemical reactions"

### Part 1: Synthesis (20 pts | ~15 min)
- **Focus:** Connect W1 reaction evidence + W2 reaction types and conservation
- **Format:** Short-answer and equation-based questions

**Synthesis Questions:**
1. Explain why a precipitate forming is evidence of a chemical reaction. What must happen to the atoms?
2. Balance this equation and identify the reaction type: Fe + HCl → FeCl₂ + H₂
3. If you burn 10 grams of wood in a sealed container, how much will everything inside weigh after burning?

**Key Connections to Make:**
| Week 1 Concept | Week 2 Application | Integration |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Evidence types | Reaction types | Each type produces specific evidence |
| Mass conservation | Balanced equations | Balancing proves conservation |
| Chemical vs physical | Atom rearrangement | Chemical = new molecules; physical = same molecules |

### Spiral Review Station (25 min)
- **Small groups rotate through review stations**
- Station A: Cycle 5 concepts (wave properties, EM spectrum)
- Station B: Cycle 6 concepts (electromagnetism, energy transfer)
- Station C: Cycle 7 Week 1 (reaction evidence, conservation)
- Station D: Cycle 7 Week 2 (reaction types, balancing)

### Direct Instruction: Assessment Prep (10 min)
- Review assessment format and expectations
- Highlight common misconception traps
- Provide test-taking strategies for constructed explanations

---

## Day 2: Cumulative Assessment

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (60 pts | ~40 min)

**Section A: Reaction Evidence (15 pts)**
- Identify evidence types from descriptions
- Distinguish chemical from physical changes
- Connect evidence to molecular-level explanations

**Section B: Mass Conservation (15 pts)**
- Predict mass outcomes in sealed vs open systems
- Explain apparent mass loss (gas escape)
- Apply conservation law to novel scenarios

**Section C: Reaction Types (15 pts)**
- Classify reactions by type from equations
- Identify patterns in reaction types
- Predict products based on reaction type

**Section D: Data Analysis (15 pts)**
- Balance chemical equations
- Analyze before/after property data
- Construct explanations using evidence

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 pts | ~20 min)

**Target Misconceptions:**
| Misconception | Question Type | Correct Understanding |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Mass is lost in reactions | Diagram + explanation | Mass conserved; gas may escape |
| Chemical = physical | Side-by-side comparison | New substance vs same substance |
| Atoms destroyed | Model-based question | Atoms rearranged, never destroyed |
| Reactions always need heat | True/False with examples | Many reactions at room temperature |

## Assessment Structure Summary

| Component | Points | Time | Focus |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min | Connect W1 + W2 |
| Part 2: Cumulative | 60 | ~40 min | All cycle content |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min | Persistent errors |
| **Total** | **100** | **~75 min** | |

## MTSS Considerations

### Tier 1 (Universal)
- Reaction evidence reference chart
- Periodic table and reaction type guide
- Balancing equations checklist

### Tier 2 (Targeted)
- Extended time (up to 1.5x)
- Reduced question load with representative sampling
- Pre-built molecular models for visualization

### Tier 3 (Intensive)
- Alternative assessment format (oral or project-based)
- One-on-one administration
- Modified rubrics focusing on core concepts

---

## Post-Assessment

### Data Analysis
- Track misconception persistence by question
- Compare to Cycle 5-6 performance
- Identify students needing Tier 2/3 support for Cycle 8

### Intervention Planning
- Schedule targeted reteach for persistent misconceptions
- Create peer tutoring pairs for balancing equations
- Prepare modified materials for Cycle 8

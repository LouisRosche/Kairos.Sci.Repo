## Targeted Misconceptions (Cycle-Wide)

| Misconception ID | Common Wrong Thinking | Correct Understanding |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| magnets-unlimited | Magnets have unlimited strength at any distance | Magnetic field strength decreases rapidly with distance; magnets can demagnetize |
| electricity-consumed | Light bulbs "use up" electricity | Energy is transformed (to light/heat), not consumed; charges flow in complete circuits |
| em-unrelated | Electricity and magnetism are completely separate | They are two aspects of one unified force (electromagnetism); each can create the other |

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check
- "Today we begin our Cycle 6 assessment. You'll show what you've learned about electricity and magnetism."
- Brief reminder of assessment format

### Part 1: Synthesis Review (15 min | 20 pts)
**Purpose:** Connect concepts from all four weeks before main assessment

**Key Connections to Make:**
1. Electricity ↔ Magnetism unification (Oersted + Faraday discoveries)
2. Energy transformation chain: Battery (chemical) → Wire (electrical) → Motor (mechanical + heat)
3. Circuit concepts applied to motors: P = IV for motor power
4. Field concepts across topics: magnetic fields, electric fields, force fields

**Questions Focus:**
| Question | Content | Points |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Q1 | Electricity-magnetism connection | 4 pts |
| Q2 | Energy transformation chain | 4 pts |
| Q3 | Circuit-motor integration | 4 pts |
| Q4 | Magnetic field applications | 4 pts |
| Q5 | System design synthesis | 4 pts |

**Teacher Notes:**
- This is formative—help students make connections before main assessment
- Walk through energy transformation example: battery → motor → wheels
- Remind students of key formulas: P = IV, Efficiency = Out/In × 100%, MA = Output Force/Input Force

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (40 min | 60 pts)
**Structure:** 4 sections, 15 pts each

#### Section A: Magnetic Fields (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| A1 | Magnetic pole interactions | 3 pts |
| A2 | Field strength vs distance | 4 pts |
| A3 | Magnetic field lines | 4 pts |
| A4 | Earth's magnetic field | 4 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- Like poles repel, opposite attract
- Field strength decreases with distance (inverse cube)
- Field lines form closed loops: N → (outside) → S → (inside) → N
- Earth's magnetic "north" is actually a magnetic south pole

#### Section B: Electromagnetism (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| B1 | Current creates magnetic field | 4 pts |
| B2 | Electromagnet strength factors | 4 pts |
| B3 | Electromagnetic induction | 4 pts |
| B4 | Motor vs generator | 3 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- Oersted's discovery: current → temporary magnetic field
- Strength factors: more current, more coils, iron core
- Faraday's discovery: changing magnetic field → induced current
- Motor: electrical → mechanical; Generator: mechanical → electrical

#### Section C: Electric Circuits (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| C1 | Ohm's Law calculation | 4 pts |
| C2 | Power calculation | 4 pts |
| C3 | Series vs parallel | 4 pts |
| C4 | Energy vs power | 3 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- I = V/R (Ohm's Law)
- P = IV (Power formula)
- Series = one path; Parallel = multiple independent paths
- Energy = Power × Time (Wh or kWh for billing)

#### Section D: Motors & Generators (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| D1 | Motor operation | 4 pts |
| D2 | Efficiency calculation | 4 pts |
| D3 | Mechanical advantage | 4 pts |
| D4 | Energy conservation | 3 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- Motors: current in coils + permanent magnets → rotation
- Efficiency = Output/Input × 100%
- MA multiplies force: Output = Input × MA
- No free force: MA trades force for distance

### Direct Instruction (10 min)
- Review any challenging concepts observed during Part 2
- Address common errors before Part 3
- Prepare students for misconception-focused questions

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Extended time for Part 2 completion
- **Extension:** Independent research on electromagnetic applications
- **Remediation:** Targeted review for struggling students

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Yesterday we completed the main assessment. Today we'll check understanding of the trickiest concepts."
- Preview Part 3 format

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 min | 20 pts)
**Purpose:** Target persistent misconceptions that affect deep understanding

| Question | Misconception Target | Points |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| M1 | magnets-unlimited | 4 pts |
| M2 | electricity-consumed | 4 pts |
| M3 | electricity-consumed (power vs consumption) | 4 pts |
| M4 | em-unrelated | 4 pts |
| M5 | Synthesis: why electromagnetism matters | 4 pts |

**Misconception Check Details:**

**M1 (magnets-unlimited):**
- Wrong: "Magnets work at any distance with constant strength"
- Correct: Field strength decreases rapidly; magnets can demagnetize from heat/impact

**M2 (electricity-consumed):**
- Wrong: "Light bulbs use up electricity"
- Correct: Energy is transformed; charges flow in complete circuits; battery's chemical energy depletes

**M3 (power clarification):**
- Wrong: "Consuming 100W means using up 100 watts"
- Correct: Measuring rate of energy transformation (100 J/s); charges aren't consumed

**M4 (em-unrelated):**
- Wrong: "Electricity and magnetism are separate"
- Correct: Demonstrations prove connection: current deflects compass; moving magnet creates current

**M5 (synthesis):**
- Connect understanding of electromagnetism to real technology
- Examples: Motors, generators, MRI machines, speakers, maglev trains

### Post-Assessment Debrief (15 min)
- Review most challenging questions as a class
- Celebrate growth from beginning of cycle
- Preview Cycle 7 connections

### MTSS Data Collection
- Record individual scores by section
- Identify students needing intervention before Cycle 7

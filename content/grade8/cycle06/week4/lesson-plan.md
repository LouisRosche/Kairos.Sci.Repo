**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS2-3 (Primary), MS-PS3-5 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Tiny Motor Mystery**
A typical car weighs about 1,500 kg (3,300 lbs). Yet a small electric car jack with a motor smaller than your fist can lift that entire car! The motor runs on 12 volts from the car battery and draws only about 15 amps—that's just 180 watts of power (about the same as two light bulbs).

**Driving Question:** How can a tiny electric motor lift a car?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain how electric motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy
2. Calculate motor efficiency using input/output power
3. Apply mechanical advantage principles to analyze force multiplication
4. Design a motor-and-gear system to meet specific lifting requirements

## Targeted Misconceptions

| Misconception ID | Wrong Thinking | Correct Understanding |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| motors-create-force | "Motors create force from nothing" | Motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy; energy is conserved but transformed |
| gears-free-energy | "Gears and pulleys create extra force for free" | Mechanical advantage trades force for distance; work in = work out (minus friction) |
| bigger-always-better | "A bigger motor is always better for any task" | Motor selection depends on required torque, speed, and efficiency for the specific application |

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question: "How can a 180W motor lift a 1,500 kg car?"
- Quick review: "What did we learn about electromagnets last week?"

### Hook: The Tiny Motor Mystery (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Electric car jack demonstration video
- **Driving Question:** How can such a small motor lift something thousands of times heavier than itself?
- **Week Connection:** "We learned how current creates magnetic fields. Now we'll see how that becomes useful motion."
- **Resource:** Car jack demonstration + motor specifications

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show video of electric car jack lifting a vehicle
- Key observation: The car rises slowly through a screw mechanism (several minutes)
- Power calculation: P = I × V = 15A × 12V = 180W
- Key question: "Where does the energy come from? Is force being 'created'?"
- Prediction prompt: "How do you think this is possible?"

### Station 1: Motor Efficiency Investigation (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Understand motor efficiency and the torque-speed tradeoff
- **Activity:** Use motor simulation to explore efficiency and energy transformation
- **Key Vocabulary:** Efficiency, torque, power, energy transformation
- **Spiral Connection:** P = I × V from Week 3 circuits

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Calculate efficiency from input/output power data
2. Observe torque-speed tradeoff under different loads
3. Investigate why motors get hot (energy "lost" to heat)
4. Apply power formula to motor energy consumption

**Key Formulas:**
| Formula | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Efficiency = (Output ÷ Input) × 100% | Calculate motor efficiency |
| Power = I × V | Calculate electrical input power |
| Energy = Power × Time | Calculate total energy consumption |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Response | Evidence |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| "Motors create force from nothing" | Energy transformation, not creation | Efficiency always < 100%—energy in must equal energy out |
| "Future motors could exceed 100% efficiency" | Violates conservation of energy | First law of thermodynamics—can't create energy |
| "Bigger motors are always better" | Application-specific requirements | Drones need speed; car jacks need torque |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Energy transformation in motors
- **Model:** Input (electrical) → Output (mechanical + heat)
- **Think-Aloud:** "If 200W goes in and 150W comes out as motion, where did the other 50W go?"
- **Visual:** Energy flow diagram with percentages

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy (not create energy)
2. Some energy always becomes heat (friction, resistance)
3. Efficiency tells us how much of our input becomes useful output
4. Torque and speed are inversely related at constant power

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete motor efficiency calculations
- **Extension:** Research electric car motor efficiency vs gasoline engines
- **Rotation:** Motor vs generator comparison with G7

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What is motor efficiency and why is it never 100%?"
- Review torque-speed tradeoff from Day 1
- Preview: "Today we'll learn how simple machines multiply force"

### Station 2: Mechanical Advantage Analysis (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Understand mechanical advantage and the force-distance tradeoff
- **Activity:** Analyze gear ratios and pulley systems
- **Key Vocabulary:** Mechanical advantage, gear ratio, force multiplication
- **Formula:** MA = Output Force ÷ Input Force

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Calculate mechanical advantage from force data
2. Analyze gear ratios (driven teeth ÷ driver teeth)
3. Investigate the distance tradeoff (MA × input distance = output distance)
4. Apply to car jack: MA = 30 means 500N lifts 15,000N

**Mechanical Advantage Table:**
| System | MA | Force Effect | Distance Effect |
|--------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Car jack | 30 | 500N lifts 15,000N | Move 9m to lift 0.3m |
| Gear 10:50 teeth | 5 | 5× torque | 1/5 speed |
| 4-pulley system | 4 | 4× force | Pull 4× distance |

**Key Insight to Reinforce:**
"If MA = 30, you only need 1/30 the force, but you must move 30× the distance. Work in = Work out. There's no free lunch in physics!"

### Station 3: Design a Lifting System (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply motor and mechanical advantage principles to engineering design
- **Activity:** Design system to lift 2,000N load using available components
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions)

**Available Components:**
| Motor | Power | Speed | Torque |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Motor A | 50W | 3000 RPM | 0.16 Nm |
| Motor B | 50W | 500 RPM | 0.96 Nm |
| Motor C | 50W | 100 RPM | 4.8 Nm |

**Available Gear Ratios:** 2:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1

**Design Requirements:**
1. Select appropriate motor (justify choice)
2. Select gear ratio to achieve ~100 Nm torque at drum
3. Calculate final lifting speed with 0.05m radius drum
4. Explain one advantage AND one limitation of design

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Guide students to Motor C (high torque) with 20:1 gears
- 4.8 Nm × 20 = 96 Nm (close to required 100 Nm)
- Final drum speed: 5 RPM → ~2.6 cm/s lifting speed
- Connect to real engineering tradeoffs (efficiency vs complexity)

  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Week 2: electromagnetism, Week 3: P = I × V)

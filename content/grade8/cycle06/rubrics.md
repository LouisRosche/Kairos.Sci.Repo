## Week 1 Rubrics: Magnetic Forces & Fields

### Station 1: Magnetic Field Mapping
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** PS2.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Describe the magnetic field pattern around a bar magnet. What does the spacing of field lines tell us?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Complete pattern + line spacing meaning + 3D understanding | "Field lines curve from north pole to south pole outside the magnet. Lines are closest together near the poles where the field is strongest. Farther from the magnet, lines spread apart showing weaker field. The field exists in 3D space all around the magnet, not just on the paper." |
| **3** | Pattern + line spacing meaning | "Lines go from N to S. Closer lines mean stronger field near the poles." |
| **2** | Pattern only | "Lines curve from one end to the other." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Lines only exist at the poles." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Force-Distance Investigation
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** PS2.B | **CCC:** Scale, Proportion, Quantity

**Question:** Based on your data, describe the relationship between distance and magnetic force. Include specific numbers.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Inverse relationship + data + rate of change | "The force decreases as distance increases, but not linearly. At 1 cm, force was 4 N; at 2 cm, it dropped to about 1 N—not half, but one-quarter. This suggests an inverse square relationship. Doubling distance = one-quarter the force." |
| **3** | Inverse relationship + data reference | "Force decreases with distance. At 1 cm it was 4 N, at 2 cm it was 1 N." |
| **2** | General relationship | "Force gets weaker farther away." |
| **1** | Incorrect relationship | "Force stays the same until you're too far." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Magnetic Levitation Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS2.B | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Design a magnetic levitation system. Explain why simple repulsion alone is unstable.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Design + stability analysis + solution approach | "My design uses ring magnets with same poles facing. Object would float above base. Problem: If object shifts slightly, it slides off sideways—repulsion pushes it away but doesn't center it (Earnshaw's theorem). Solution approach: Add a guide track or use diamagnetic material for passive stability, or active feedback with sensors and electromagnets." |
| **4** | Design + stability problem identified | "Use repelling magnets. Problem: object will slide sideways when disturbed." |
| **3** | Design with partial reasoning | "Stack magnets facing the same way to push object up." |
| **2** | Design without physics | "Put magnets underneath." |
| **1** | Unrealistic design | "Just make the magnets stronger." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Electromagnetism & Energy Transfer

### Station 1: Electromagnet Construction
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** PS2.B | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** What factors affect electromagnet strength? Explain the physics behind each factor.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | 3+ factors + physics explanation for each | "1) More coil turns: each turn adds to the magnetic field, so fields stack up. 2) More current: more moving charges create stronger field. 3) Iron core: iron is ferromagnetic—its atomic magnets align with the external field, amplifying it. Without core, you just have the wire's weak field." |
| **3** | 3 factors + partial explanation | "More turns, more current, and iron core all make it stronger." |
| **2** | 1-2 factors | "More wire makes it stronger." |
| **1** | Incorrect factors | "Using bigger magnets." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Electromagnetic Induction
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** PS3.A | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** Why does moving a magnet through a coil create current, but holding it still does not?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Change is key + field explanation + energy | "Current is induced only when the magnetic field through the coil is CHANGING. When the magnet moves, field lines 'cut' through the wire, pushing electrons along. Holding still = constant field = no change = no force on electrons. Energy comes from the motion—you do work moving the magnet, which becomes electrical energy." |
| **3** | Change is key + basic explanation | "The field has to be changing. Moving changes the field; holding still doesn't." |
| **2** | Partial understanding | "Moving creates electricity, still doesn't." |
| **1** | Major misconception | "The magnet needs to be inside to work." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Motor Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS3.A | **CCC:** Systems

**Question:** Explain why a motor needs a commutator to spin continuously.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Pole switching + timing + continuous motion | "The commutator reverses the current direction every half-turn. Without it, the coil would turn until its poles align with the permanent magnet, then stop—stuck in equilibrium. The commutator switches poles at exactly the right moment so the coil is always being pushed the same rotational direction. It's like pushing a swing at the right time each cycle." |
| **4** | Pole switching + continuous motion | "Commutator switches poles so the coil keeps being pushed around instead of stopping." |
| **3** | Basic function | "It changes the direction of electricity." |
| **2** | Vague answer | "The commutator makes it spin." |
| **1** | Incorrect | "It stores energy for the motor." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 3 Rubrics: Synthesis & Assessment

### Synthesis Question
**Question:** A generator and a motor are "reverse" of each other. Explain this relationship and the energy transformations in each.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Both devices explained + reversibility + energy paths | "Motor: electrical energy → magnetic force → mechanical motion. Generator: mechanical motion → changing magnetic field → electrical energy. They're reverse because the same device can do both! Spin a motor manually = it generates voltage. Force current through a generator = it spins. Energy is always conserved—just transformed between forms." |
| **4** | Both devices + energy transformations | "Motor turns electricity into motion. Generator turns motion into electricity. Energy changes form in each." |
| **3** | One device well explained | "A generator spins magnets to make electricity." |
| **2** | General understanding | "They're opposites." |
| **1** | Misconception | "Motors and generators are completely different." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

| "Electricity is used up" | Energy is transformed; charge flows in complete circuits | "Where does the electricity 'go' in a light bulb?" |
| "E & M are separate" | They are unified—moving charges create magnetic fields | "Why does a compass move near a wire with current?" |

# Grade 8 Cycle 6 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Magnetic Forces & Fields

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS2-3 (Primary), MS-PS4-2 & MS-LS2-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Invisible Force Mystery**
Hold a magnet above a table. Slowly move another magnet underneath. At some point, the top magnet jumps or spins—the force acts right through solid wood! But why do some magnets attract from inches away while others only work when touching? And why does distance matter so much?

**Driving Question:** Why do some magnets attract through tables while others don't?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Describe magnetic fields and how they extend through space
2. Explain how distance affects magnetic force strength
3. Identify factors that influence magnetic field strength
4. Design investigations to test magnetic force relationships

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What do you know about magnets? Where have you encountered them?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Magnets through various materials demonstration
- **Driving Question:** Why do some magnets work through tables while others don't?
- **Week Connection:** "We studied waves moving through materials. Can forces move through materials too?"
- **Materials:** Strong neodymium magnet, weak ceramic magnet, various barrier materials
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on force concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Demonstrate strong magnet attracting through table, book, hand
- Show weak magnet barely works through paper
- Key question: "What's happening in the space between the magnets?"
- "Today we'll visualize the invisible—magnetic fields"

### Station 1: Magnetic Field Mapping (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Visualize magnetic fields and identify field patterns
- **Activity:** Use iron filings and compass arrays to map field lines
- **Key Vocabulary:** Magnetic field, field lines, poles, magnetic domain
- **Spiral Connection:** Wave field patterns from Cycle 5

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Place bar magnet under paper
2. Sprinkle iron filings carefully
3. Sketch observed pattern
4. Use compass to determine field direction
5. Repeat with different pole arrangements
6. Compare single magnet vs two magnets

**Key Observations to Guide:**
| Magnet Arrangement | Field Pattern | Observations |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Single bar magnet | Lines curve from N to S | Stronger near poles |
| Two attracting | Lines connect poles | Field lines merge |
| Two repelling | Lines push apart | Field lines compress |
| Horseshoe magnet | Strong between poles | Concentrated field |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Fields exist only near poles" | Fields extend in all directions, weaker with distance | Map field lines far from magnet |
| "Magnets attract everything" | Only ferromagnetic materials (iron, nickel, cobalt) | Test various materials |
| "Bigger magnets are always stronger" | Field strength depends on material and magnetization | Compare sizes vs strengths |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Magnetic field properties and the inverse relationship
- **Model:** How field strength decreases with distance
- **Think-Aloud:** "If I double the distance from a magnet, what happens to the force?"
- **Visual:** Field line density diagrams showing strength variation

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Magnetic fields exist in 3D space around magnets
2. Field lines show direction and relative strength
3. Closer lines = stronger field
4. Force decreases rapidly with distance (inverse square-like behavior)

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete field mapping observations
- **Extension:** Research how Earth's magnetic field protects us
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on field concepts

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What do magnetic field lines show us?"
- Review field patterns from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Force-Distance Investigation (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Quantify relationship between distance and magnetic force
- **Activity:** Measure force at various distances using spring scales
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy transfer concepts from Cycle 4

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Set up magnet attached to spring scale
2. Position second magnet at measured distances
3. Record force reading at each distance
4. Graph force vs distance
5. Identify mathematical pattern

**Data Collection Table:**
| Distance (cm) | Force (N) | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| 0.5 | ? | Closest |
| 1.0 | ? | |
| 2.0 | ? | |
| 4.0 | ? | |
| 8.0 | ? | |

**Analysis Questions:**
1. How does doubling the distance affect the force?
2. Is the relationship linear, exponential, or inverse?
3. Predict the force at 16 cm based on your data.

### Station 3: Design a Magnetic Levitation Device (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply force understanding to engineering design
- **Activity:** Design system to levitate an object using magnetic repulsion
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-1 (Asking Questions) + SEP-3 (Planning Investigations)

**Design Challenge:**
Design a display stand that uses magnetic levitation to suspend a small object (like a spinning globe) without touching any support.

**Design Requirements:**
1. Object must levitate at least 1 cm above base
2. Must be stable (not flip or fall)
3. Design must account for force-distance relationship
4. Include method to keep object centered

**Design Plan Must Include:**
1. Magnet arrangement with pole orientations
2. Force calculations at operating distance
3. Stability analysis (why won't it flip?)
4. Sketch with dimensions

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Guide students: Repulsion alone is unstable (Earnshaw's theorem)
- Real devices use diamagnetic materials or feedback systems
- Focus on understanding the challenge, not perfect solution
- Connect to real maglev trains

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (magnetic fields, force-distance)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 5: wave fields; Cycle 4: energy)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect field patterns to force)
  - 1 SEP-1 question (Ask testable question about magnets)

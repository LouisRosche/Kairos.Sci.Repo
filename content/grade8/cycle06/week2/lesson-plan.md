# Grade 8 Cycle 6 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Electromagnetism & Energy Transfer

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS2-3 (Primary), MS-PS4-2 & MS-LS2-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Generator Mystery**
At a science museum, you crank a handle and a light bulb glows. There are no batteries—just spinning magnets inside the handle. At a power plant, giant turbines spin day and night, and somehow this motion becomes electricity in your home 100 miles away. What's the connection between spinning and electricity?

**Driving Question:** How can spinning a magnet create electricity?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain how electric current creates magnetic fields
2. Describe electromagnetic induction
3. Identify factors affecting induced current
4. Design devices that convert between electricity and motion

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What creates a magnetic field? Only magnets?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Hand-crank generator lighting an LED
- **Driving Question:** How does motion create electricity?
- **Week 1 Connection:** "We studied magnetic fields. Can we create them without permanent magnets?"
- **Materials:** Hand-crank generator, LED, galvanometer
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on Week 1 concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Demonstrate: crank generator → LED lights
- Stop cranking → light goes out immediately
- Key question: "What's happening inside?"
- Reveal: spinning magnets past wires
- "Today we discover the hidden connection between electricity and magnetism"

### Station 1: Electromagnet Construction (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Build electromagnets and test affecting variables
- **Activity:** Wind coils around iron cores, connect to batteries, test strength
- **Key Vocabulary:** Electromagnet, solenoid, current, coil, core
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy flow from Cycle 4

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Wind 10 turns of wire around iron nail
2. Connect to battery (briefly!)
3. Test strength (how many paper clips?)
4. Add 10 more turns, test again
5. Try different core materials
6. Record all observations

**Variable Testing:**
| Variable | How to Test | Expected Result |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Number of turns | 10, 20, 30 turns | More turns = stronger |
| Current (batteries) | 1, 2, 3 batteries | More current = stronger |
| Core material | Iron, aluminum, air | Iron core = strongest |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Only permanent magnets create fields" | Moving charges create magnetic fields | Compass near wire with current |
| "Electromagnets are permanent" | Turn off current → field disappears | Demonstrate on/off behavior |
| "More wire = stronger" | More *turns* matter, not total wire length | Test coiled vs straight wire |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Oersted's discovery and electromagnetic unification
- **Model:** How moving charges create magnetic fields
- **Think-Aloud:** "If current creates magnetism, can magnetism create current?"
- **Visual:** Field lines around current-carrying wire

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Hans Christian Oersted (1820): compass near wire deflected when current flows
2. Moving electric charges create magnetic fields
3. This unifies electricity and magnetism: electromagnetism
4. If electricity → magnetism, then magnetism → electricity (Faraday)

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "How do we make an electromagnet stronger?"
- Review the electricity-magnetism connection
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Electromagnetic Induction Lab (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Investigate factors affecting induced current
- **Activity:** Move magnets through coils, measure induced current
- **Spiral Connection:** Wave interactions with materials from Cycle 5

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Connect coil to galvanometer
2. Quickly push magnet into coil
3. Record galvanometer deflection
4. Try: slow vs fast motion
5. Try: different numbers of coil turns
6. Try: stronger vs weaker magnets

**Data Collection:**
| Variable Changed | Observation | Induced Current |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fast motion | Needle deflects more | Higher |
| Slow motion | Small deflection | Lower |
| More coil turns | Larger effect | Higher |
| Stronger magnet | Larger effect | Higher |
| No motion | No deflection | Zero |

**Key Discovery:**
- Current is induced only when there's CHANGE
- Stationary magnet in coil = no current
- Motion (changing field) = current

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why does the galvanometer deflect opposite ways when you push in vs pull out?
2. What happens if you hold the magnet still inside the coil?
3. How is this related to how power plants work?

### Station 3: Design an Electric Motor (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply electromagnetism to device design
- **Activity:** Design a simple motor using electromagnet principles
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-3 (Planning Investigations) + SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations)

**Design Challenge:**
Design a simple electric motor that converts electrical energy into rotational motion. Your design should spin continuously when connected to a battery.

**Design Requirements:**
1. Must use electromagnetic principles
2. Must rotate continuously (not just twitch)
3. Must include a way to reverse magnetic poles during rotation
4. Draw clear diagram with labels

**Design Elements to Include:**
1. Rotating coil (armature)
2. Permanent magnets for field
3. Commutator (pole-switching mechanism)
4. Power source connection

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Real motors switch poles at just the right moment
- Commutator is the key to continuous rotation
- Energy transformation: electrical → magnetic → mechanical
- Connect to real motors in everyday devices

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (electromagnets, induction)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Week 1: field strength; Cycle 5: EM waves)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect motor to generator)
  - 1 SEP-3 question (Design investigation about induction)

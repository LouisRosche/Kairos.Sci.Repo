## Overview

This cycle explores the unified nature of electricity and magnetism, building from magnetic field investigations to the fundamental connection between moving charges and magnetic fields. Students discover that what seem like separate phenomena—magnetism and electricity—are deeply related, setting the foundation for understanding motors, generators, and electromagnetic waves.

## Driving Phenomena

| Week | Phenomenon | Driving Question |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Week 1 | Some magnets work through surfaces while others don't | "Why do some magnets attract through tables while others don't?" |
| Week 2 | Spinning magnets can light up bulbs | "How can spinning a magnet create electricity?" |
| Week 3 | Synthesis & Assessment | Integrated understanding of electromagnetism |

## Standards Alignment

### Primary Standard
- **MS-PS2-3:** Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces.

### Spiral Standards
| Code | Description | From Cycle | Integration Point |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| MS-PS4-2 | Wave behavior through materials | Cycle 5 | EM waves connect to EM fields |

## 3D Learning Framework

### Science & Engineering Practices (SEPs)
| Practice | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **SEP-1:** Asking Questions | Ask testable questions about magnetic force factors |
| **SEP-3:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | Design experiments to test force-distance relationships |
| **SEP-4:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | Interpret force and field strength data |

### Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)
| DCI | Key Concept |
|-----|-------------|
| **PS2.B:** Types of Interactions | Electric and magnetic forces act at a distance; strength depends on distance and other factors |
| **PS3.A:** Definitions of Energy | Energy is transferred through electric currents and magnetic fields |

### Cross-Cutting Concepts (CCCs)
| CCC | Application |
|-----|-------------|
| **CCC-2:** Cause and Effect | Distance, current, and field strength cause predictable force effects |
| **CCC-3:** Scale, Proportion, Quantity | Force decreases with distance; quantify relationships |
| **CCC-5:** Energy and Matter | Energy flows through circuits; electromagnetic induction |

## Target Misconceptions

| ID | Misconception | Correct Understanding | Frequency | Targeting Strategy |
|----|---------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| magnets-unlimited | Magnets have unlimited strength/never wear out | Magnetic strength decreases with distance (inverse relationship); magnets can demagnetize | 55% | Distance-force graphing, demagnetization demo |
| electricity-consumed | Electricity is "used up" in devices | Energy is transformed, not consumed; charge flows in complete circuits | 50% | Conservation of energy tracking, complete circuit models |
| em-unrelated | Electricity and magnetism are completely separate | They are unified (electromagnetism); moving charges create magnetic fields | 45% | Oersted's experiment, electromagnet construction |

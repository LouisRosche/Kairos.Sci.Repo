# Grade 8 Cycle 4: Genetics & Heredity
## PLACEHOLDER - To Be Developed

**Target NGSS Standards:**
- MS-LS3-1: Develop and use a model to describe why mutations may result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects
- MS-LS3-2: Develop and use a model to describe why asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic information

**Phenomenon:** [To be determined - suggest genetic disorder inheritance or selective breeding]

## Week-by-Week Structure

### Week 1: DNA & Genes
- **Hook:** Why do offspring resemble parents?
- **Station 1:** DNA structure exploration
- **Station 2:** Gene expression modeling
- **Station 3:** Trait inheritance patterns
- **Exit:** Genetic inheritance explanation

### Week 2: Mutations & Variation
- **Hook:** How do new traits appear in populations?
- **Station 1:** Mutation types analysis
- **Station 2:** Beneficial vs harmful mutations
- **Station 3:** Connection to natural selection (Cycle 3 spiral)
- **Exit:** Mutation effects prediction

### Week 3: Heredity & Probability
- **Hook:** Genetic counseling scenario
- **Station 1:** Punnett square application
- **Station 2:** Multi-trait inheritance
- **Station 3:** Probability calculations
- **Exit:** 3D Integration assessment

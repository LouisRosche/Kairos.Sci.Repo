## NGSS Alignment

### Primary Standard
**MS-LS2-3:** Develop a model to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy among living and nonliving parts of an ecosystem.

### Spiral Standards
| Standard | Description | From Cycle |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| MS-LS4-4 | Natural selection and adaptation | Cycle 3 |
| MS-PS2-2 | Force and motion relationships | Cycle 2 |

### 3-Dimensional Learning
- **SEP:** Developing Models (SEP-2), Analyzing Data (SEP-4)
- **DCI:** LS2.B Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer, LS2.C Ecosystem Dynamics
- **CCC:** Energy and Matter (CCC-5), Systems and System Models (CCC-4)

## Anchoring Phenomenon

**Why are there more plants than animals in most ecosystems?**

In the Serengeti, there are millions of wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles. But there are only a few thousand lions and hyenas. Why? And where does all the energy go at each level?

## Week-by-Week Structure

### Week 1: Energy Pyramids & Trophic Levels
**Phenomenon:** Why are there more plants than animals in most ecosystems?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Missing Energy Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | 10% Rule Investigation | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Biomass Calculations | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design a Sustainable Farm | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Energy Flow Integration | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Trace energy flow through trophic levels
2. Apply the 10% rule to calculate energy transfer
3. Calculate and compare biomass at different levels
4. Design a sustainable food production system

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Energy is recycled like matter in ecosystems" → Energy flows, matter cycles
- "Energy pyramids are always stable" → Can be disrupted
- "Producers have more energy than consumers" → More available, but lost as heat

### Week 2: Ecosystem Disruption & Invasive Species
**Phenomenon:** How do invasive species disrupt energy flow?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Cane Toad Disaster | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Modeling Disruption | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Case Study Analysis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design an Intervention | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Ecosystem Dynamics | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Model cascade effects when species are added/removed
2. Analyze real-world invasive species data
3. Predict ecosystem responses to disruption
4. Design and evaluate intervention strategies

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Ecosystems always return to normal" → Some changes are irreversible
- "Invasive species are always bad" → Context-dependent
- "Only predators affect prey" → Trophic cascades go both directions

### Week 3: Synthesis & Assessment
**Focus:** Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycle 3

| Component | Points | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Part 2: Cumulative Assessment | 60 | ~40 min |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min |

## Cycle 3 → Cycle 4 Connections

| Cycle 3 Concept | Cycle 4 Application |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Natural selection | Why efficient energy transfer is selected for |
| Adaptation | How organisms adapt to trophic position |
| Population dynamics | Energy limits population sizes |
| Evolution evidence | Coevolution of predator-prey relationships |

## MTSS Considerations

### Tier 1 (Universal)
- Sentence starters for all open-response questions
- Word banks with cycle-specific vocabulary
- Async alternatives with pre-collected data

### Tier 2 (Targeted)
- Pre-built energy pyramid templates
- Step-by-step calculation guides
- Video alternatives for simulations

### Tier 3 (Intensive)
- Modified assessment with reduced question load
- One-on-one 10% rule review
- Graphic organizers for system thinking

### Key Vocabulary
| Term | Definition | Station |
|------|------------|---------|
| Trophic level | Position in food chain (1=producer, 2=primary consumer, etc.) | W1 Hook |
| 10% rule | Only ~10% of energy transfers between trophic levels | W1 S1 |
| Biomass | Total mass of organisms at a trophic level | W1 S2 |
| Energy pyramid | Diagram showing energy decrease at each level | W1 S2 |
| Invasive species | Non-native organism that disrupts ecosystem | W2 Hook |
| Trophic cascade | Indirect effects rippling through food web | W2 S1 |

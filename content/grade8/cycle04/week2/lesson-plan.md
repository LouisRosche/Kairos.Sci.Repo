# Grade 8 Cycle 4 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Ecosystem Disruption & Invasive Species

**NGSS:** MS-LS2-3 | **Duration:** 5 days | **Points:** 100

---

## Overview

Students investigate how invasive species disrupt energy flow and cause trophic cascades, building on Week 1's energy pyramid concepts and connecting to Cycle 3's natural selection.

### Phenomenon
**How do invasive species disrupt energy flow?**
- 1935: 102 cane toads introduced to Australia
- Today: 200+ million cane toads, native predators dying from toxins
- Result: Cascade effects throughout Australian ecosystems

### Learning Targets
1. Explain how invasive species disrupt energy flow in ecosystems
2. Model the cascade effects of species removal or addition
3. Analyze real-world invasive species case studies
4. Design and evaluate intervention strategies

---

## Standards Alignment

### Primary Standard
**MS-LS2-3:** Develop a model to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy among living and nonliving parts of an ecosystem.

### 3-Dimensional Learning
| Dimension | Component |
|-----------|-----------|

| **DCI** | LS2.B: Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer |
| | LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience |
| **CCC** | CCC-4: Systems and System Models |
| | CCC-7: Stability and Change |

### Spiral Standards
- MS-LS4-4: Natural selection and adaptation (Cycle 3)
- MS-LS2-4: Changes to components affect populations (Cycle 3)

## Daily Schedule

### Day 1: Hook + Station 1 Setup
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5 min | Warm-up: Review Week 1 energy pyramid |
| 10 min | Hook: The Cane Toad Disaster |
| 5 min | Transition + Station 1 intro |
| 18 min | Station 1: Modeling Disruption |
| 7 min | Debrief + preview Day 2 |

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show cane toad documentary clip (2-3 min) before Hook
- Have Yellowstone food web diagram displayed
- Key misconception to surface: "Ecosystems are always stable"

### Day 2: Stations 2-3
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5 min | Warm-up: Define "trophic cascade" |
| 15 min | Station 2: Case Study Analysis |
| 5 min | Transition |
| 20 min | Station 3: Design an Intervention |

**Teacher Notes:**
- Distribute case study data packets before Station 2
- For Station 3, display intervention options comparison chart
- Circulate during engineering challenge to check budget constraints

### Day 3: Exit Ticket + Synthesis
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5 min | Warm-up: Connect invasive species to Week 1 |
| 15 min | Exit Ticket: Ecosystem Dynamics |
| 15 min | Whole-class synthesis discussion |
| 10 min | Preview Week 3 assessment |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How are Week 1 (energy flow) and Week 2 (disruption) connected?
2. Why do island ecosystems suffer more from invasive species?
3. How does the 10% rule help explain why losing predators matters?

## Misconceptions to Target

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Targeted In |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ecosystems are always stable | Ecosystems are dynamic and can be disrupted | Hook MTSS, S1 Q4 |
| Energy is recycled like matter | Energy flows through (lost as heat); matter cycles | S1 Q3, Exit Q3 |
| Removing one species has no effect | Keystone species removal causes cascades | S1 Q1-Q2, Exit Q1 |
| Biocontrol is always safe | Biocontrol agents can become invasive themselves | S3 Q3 |

---

---

## Extension Activities

### Early Finishers
- Research local invasive species: What's in your region? How did it arrive?
- Design infographic explaining trophic cascades for younger students

### Challenge
- Calculate: If removing wolves increased elk by 5×, and elk eat 10 kg/day of willows, how much biomass was lost over 70 years?
- Research: What biocontrol agents have worked? What made them successful vs. failures?

---

## Case Study Reference

### Yellowstone Wolves (Modeling Disruption)
- 1926: Last wolves killed
- 1926-1995: Elk population ~4,000 → 20,000+
- Result: Willows/aspens overgrazed, beaver populations crashed, river banks eroded
- 1995: 31 wolves reintroduced
- Result: "Ecology of fear" - elk avoided riverbeds, vegetation recovered, beavers returned

### Cane Toads (Intervention Design)
- Problem: Toxic skin kills native predators who eat them
- Current approaches: Community trapping events, barrier fencing
- Potential: Gene drive technology (still in research)
- Challenge: No native predators evolved to avoid their toxins

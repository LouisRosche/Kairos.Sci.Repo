## Week 1 Rubrics: Energy Pyramids & Trophic Levels

### Station 1: 10% Rule Application
**SEP:** Analyzing Data | **DCI:** LS2.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** If grass contains 10,000 kcal of energy, how much is available to a tertiary consumer (e.g., lion)?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct (10 kcal) + work shown + reasoning | "10,000 → 1,000 (zebra) → 100 (hyena) → 10 (lion). The lion gets only 10 kcal because 90% is lost at each transfer to heat, movement, and waste." |
| **3** | Correct with partial work | "10,000 × 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 = 10 kcal" |
| **2** | Correct method but arithmetic error | "10,000 × 0.1 × 0.1 = 10 kcal" (stopped at secondary) |
| **1** | Wrong method | "10,000 ÷ 4 = 2,500 kcal" (divided by levels instead of 10%) |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Dividing by trophic level number instead of multiplying by 0.10 → Review "10% transfers, not divides"
- Forgetting intermediate steps → Emphasize each arrow is a 90% loss

### Station 1: Energy Loss Explanation
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** LS2.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** Explain where the 90% of "lost" energy goes at each trophic level.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | 3+ destinations + correct reasoning + "lost to system" concept | "The 90% goes to: (1) heat from metabolism—running, breathing, digesting; (2) waste—feces and urine that decomposers get; (3) parts not eaten—bones, fur, hooves. It's 'lost' to the FOOD WEB but not destroyed—the energy just leaves that system as heat." |
| **3** | 3 destinations + partial reasoning | "Heat from moving around, waste products, and parts predators don't eat." |
| **2** | 2 destinations | "Heat and waste." |
| **1** | 1 destination or misconception | "The energy just disappears." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Misconception Alert:** "Energy is recycled" → Emphasize energy flows ONE WAY

### Station 2: Biomass Calculation

**Question:** If producers have 4,000,000 kg biomass and the 10% rule applies, what biomass would secondary consumers have?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct (40,000 kg) + work shown | "4,000,000 × 0.10 = 400,000 (primary) × 0.10 = 40,000 kg (secondary)" |
| **3** | Correct answer, limited work | "40,000 kg" |
| **2** | One level calculated correctly | "400,000 kg" (stopped at primary) |
| **1** | Major calculation error | "4,000,000 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 ÷ 10 = 4,000" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Sustainable Farm Design
**SEP:** Developing Models | **DCI:** LS2.B | **CCC:** Systems Thinking

**Question:** Design a 100-hectare farm to feed 1,000 people (2,000,000 kcal/day) within $500,000 budget.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Meets calorie goal + under budget + efficiency reasoning + trade-offs | "40 ha vegetables (40×50,000=2,000,000 kcal ✓) at $80,000. Use remaining 60 ha and $420,000 for protein variety: 20 ha chicken ($100,000) for 100,000 kcal. Vegetables are most efficient because they're producers (level 1). Trade-off: less protein variety but sustainable." |
| **4** | Meets goal + under budget + efficiency reasoning | "All vegetables: 40 hectares × 50,000 = 2,000,000 kcal. Cost $80,000. Efficient because eating producers skips energy loss." |
| **3** | Meets goal OR under budget + some reasoning | "Mix of vegetables and chicken to meet goal." |
| **2** | Attempt but doesn't meet constraints | "100 ha cattle = 250,000 kcal" (way under goal) |
| **1** | Major issues | "Grow whatever we want." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP-2 + DCI LS2.B/LS4.B + CCC Energy and Matter**

**Question:** Explain how the 10% rule creates selection pressure for organisms.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Connects energy scarcity + natural selection + specific adaptations | "Since only 10% transfers, apex predators have very little energy available. This creates selection pressure for: (1) efficient hunting—wasting energy on failed hunts is fatal; (2) smaller populations—not enough energy for many lions; (3) strategic behaviors—lions rest 20 hrs/day to conserve energy. Energy scarcity drives evolution." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Connects energy scarcity + selection | "There's less energy at top levels, so predators that waste energy don't survive. Efficient hunters are selected for." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Partial connection | "Animals that can't find food die." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | No connection made | "The 10% rule doesn't affect evolution." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Ecosystem Disruption & Invasive Species

### Station 1: Cascade Tracing
**SEP:** Developing Models | **DCI:** LS2.C | **CCC:** Systems Thinking

**Question:** Trace the cascade when wolves were removed from Yellowstone: Wolves → ? → ? → ? → River banks eroding

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Complete chain + cause-effect language | "Wolves removed → Elk population explodes (no predation) → Elk overgraze willows along rivers (no fear of predators near water) → Beavers can't build dams (no willow trees) → River banks erode (no vegetation roots or beaver dams). Each step CAUSES the next." |
| **3** | Most steps correct + some causation | "No wolves → More elk → Less willows → River erosion." |
| **2** | Partial chain | "No wolves → More elk → Erosion." (Missing middle steps) |
| **1** | Identifies direction but incomplete | "Wolves leaving was bad for rivers." |
| **0** | No response or wrong direction | Blank |

---

### Station 2: Invasive Species Analysis

**Question:** Explain why island species are often MORE vulnerable to invasive species than mainland species.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Evolutionary explanation + multiple factors + example | "Island species evolved in isolation with no exposure to mainland predators. They never developed defenses—some island birds lost the ability to fly because there were no predators. When cats or rats arrive, island species don't recognize them as threats and don't flee. Hawaiian honeycreepers had no immunity to avian malaria, so mosquitoes devastated them." |
| **3** | Evolutionary explanation + one factor | "Island species didn't evolve with predators so they have no defenses." |
| **2** | Partial explanation | "Islands are smaller so species have nowhere to hide." |
| **1** | Misconception | "Island species are weaker." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3: Intervention Design
**SEP:** Designing Solutions | **DCI:** LS2.C | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** Evaluate: Introduce a predator to control an invasive species.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Pros + cons + historical example + recommendation | "Biocontrol can work (ladybugs for aphids) but has risks. The cane toad was introduced to Australia to control beetles, but it became the invasive species. The predator might eat natives instead, or become invasive itself. I'd only use biocontrol if: (1) the predator is native, (2) it's been tested on islands first, (3) there's a backup removal plan." |
| **4** | Pros + cons + recommendation | "It could work but might backfire. The predator could become invasive. Only use if well-researched." |
| **3** | Acknowledges both sides | "It might help but could also cause problems." |
| **2** | Only pros OR only cons | "This is too risky—never introduce new species." |
| **1** | Uncritical acceptance | "Great idea—predators solve everything." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D)
**SEP-2 + DCI LS2.C + CCC Stability and Change**

**Question:** How does the 10% rule help explain why removing keystone species is so damaging?

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Connects energy flow + keystone effects + cascade | "Keystone species often control populations at lower trophic levels. When wolves (keystone) are removed, elk multiply and eat more plants. But because of the 10% rule, removing ONE apex predator affects MANY more organisms below—1 wolf's energy came from 10 elk which came from 100× more grass. Small changes at the top cascade hugely at the bottom." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Connects 10% rule + keystone | "Keystone species affect everything below them, and because of energy loss, there are fewer predators controlling many more prey." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Partial connection | "Removing keystone species causes big effects." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | No connection | "The 10% rule doesn't relate to keystone species." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 3 Rubrics: Synthesis & Assessment

### Part 1: Synthesis Connection

**Question:** How do the 10% rule (Week 1) and trophic cascades (Week 2) work together to explain ecosystem dynamics?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Both concepts integrated + mechanism explained + example | "The 10% rule means energy decreases up the food chain, so there are fewer top predators. This makes keystone species removal so damaging—one predator controlled many prey. When wolves were removed, their prey (elk) multiplied 5×, eating 50× more plants because of the energy pyramid. The cascade amplifies through the 10% rule." |
| **4** | Both concepts + connection | "The 10% rule explains why there are few predators, and cascades explain what happens when those few are removed." |
| **3** | One concept well-explained + attempts connection | "The 10% rule limits energy at top levels. Removing predators causes cascades." |
| **2** | Both mentioned but not connected | "10% rule is about energy. Cascades are about food webs." |
| **1** | Only one concept | "The 10% rule means energy is lost." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment - Novel Scenario

**Question:** A lake ecosystem has: 1,000,000 kcal algae → zooplankton → small fish → bass → osprey. If a disease kills 50% of bass, predict what happens to each level.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | All levels predicted + 10% rule applied + cascade reasoning | "Osprey: Less food, population decreases. Small fish: 50% less predation → population increases. Zooplankton: More fish eating them → population decreases. Algae: Less zooplankton grazing → may increase. This is a TOP-DOWN cascade—removing bass affects all levels below. The energy changes are magnified by the 10% rule at each level." |
| **4** | Most levels + reasoning | "Osprey decline (less food). Small fish increase (less predation). Effects cascade down." |
| **3** | Some levels + partial reasoning | "Osprey have less to eat. Small fish might increase." |
| **2** | One level predicted correctly | "Osprey would have less food." |
| **1** | Incorrect predictions | "Nothing would change." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 3: Misconception Check

**Question:** TRUE or FALSE and explain: "Energy is recycled in ecosystems just like matter."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + explains difference + examples | "FALSE. Matter (carbon, nitrogen) cycles—atoms are reused forever. Energy flows ONE WAY: sun → producers → consumers → heat. At each level, 90% is lost as heat and can't be reused. That's why we need constant sunlight—ecosystems can't recycle energy." |
| **3** | FALSE + explains difference | "FALSE. Matter cycles but energy flows and is lost as heat." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal explanation | "FALSE. Energy is used up." |
| **1** | TRUE or FALSE with wrong reasoning | "TRUE. Decomposers recycle energy." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

**Question:** TRUE or FALSE and explain: "Ecosystems always return to normal after disturbance."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + explains permanence + examples | "FALSE. Some changes are irreversible. When species go extinct (like the dodo), they can't return. Invasive species like kudzu permanently change ecosystems. Even Yellowstone took decades to partially recover after wolves returned, and some damage (species lost) can never be undone." |
| **3** | FALSE + one example | "FALSE. Extinct species can't come back." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal explanation | "FALSE. Some damage is permanent." |
| **1** | TRUE or FALSE with wrong reasoning | "TRUE. Nature heals itself eventually." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

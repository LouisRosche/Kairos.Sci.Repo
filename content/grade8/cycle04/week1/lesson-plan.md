## Detailed Component Breakdown

### Hook: The Missing Energy Mystery (12 pts, ~10 min)

**Driving Question:** Why are there SO MANY plants and herbivores, but SO FEW top predators in the Serengeti?

**Teacher Setup:**
1. Display Serengeti ecosystem image on projector
2. Share population data visually:
   - Millions of pounds of grasses
   - Hundreds of thousands of wildebeest, zebras, gazelles
   - Only a few thousand lions and hyenas

**Student Activities:**
- Q1: Observe ecosystem patterns (3 pts, auto-graded)
- MTSS Flag: Diagnose energy misconceptions (0 pts, diagnostic)
- Q2: Predict why predators are rare (3 pts, manual)
- Q3: Connect to Cycle 3 natural selection (3 pts, auto-graded)
- Q4: Identify energy source (3 pts, auto-graded)
- Self-assessment: Confidence check (0 pts, diagnostic)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Look for misconception: "Energy is recycled like matter"
- Connect to prior knowledge from Cycle 3 evolution unit
- Emphasize the mystery - we'll solve it with data

---

### Station 1: 10% Rule Investigation (20 pts, ~18 min)

**Big Idea:** Only ~10% of energy transfers between trophic levels; 90% is "lost" to heat, movement, and waste.

**Reference Data Provided:**
```
When a zebra eats 1000 kcal of grass:
- 60% lost to heat (metabolism)
- 25% lost to waste (feces, urine)
- 5% parts not eaten (roots, etc.)
- 10% stored in zebra body → available to lions
```

**Student Activities:**
- Q1: Apply 10% rule calculation (4 pts, auto-graded)
- Q2: Explain where 90% goes (4 pts, manual - require 3 destinations)
- Q3: Food chain calculation (4 pts, auto-graded)
- Q4: Explain pyramid shape (4 pts, manual)
- Q5: Connect to Cycle 3 natural selection (4 pts, auto-graded)

**Teacher Circulate Focus:**
- Check calculations: multiply by 0.10 for each level
- Address misconception: energy is NOT recycled
- Scaffold: "Think about what animals DO all day - run, breathe, digest..."

---

### Station 2: Biomass Calculations (20 pts, ~15 min)

**Big Idea:** Biomass decreases at higher trophic levels because less energy is available.

**Reference Data Provided:**
| Trophic Level | Biomass (kg/km²) | Population/100 km² |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Producers (grass) | 4,000,000 | N/A |
| Primary (wildebeest) | 400,000 | 1,500 |
| Secondary (lions) | 40,000 | 25 |

**Conversion:** 1 kg biomass ≈ 5 kcal stored energy

**Student Activities:**
- Q1: Calculate biomass ratio (4 pts, auto-graded)
- Q2: Energy calculation with work shown (4 pts, manual)
- Q3: Inverted pyramid explanation (4 pts, auto-graded)
- Q4: Drought prediction (4 pts, manual)
- Q5: Human diet efficiency (4 pts, auto-graded)

**Calculator Required:** Students need calculators for this station.

### Station 3: Design a Sustainable Farm (25 pts, ~20 min)

**Engineering Challenge:** Design a 100-hectare farm to feed 1,000 people sustainably.

**Constraints:**
- Goal: 2,000,000 kcal/day total (2,000 kcal × 1,000 people)
- Land: 100 hectares available
- Budget: $500,000 to set up

**Options Table:**
| Option | kcal/hectare/day | Cost/hectare |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| A. Vegetables | 50,000 | $2,000 |
| B. Chicken | 5,000 | $5,000 |
| C. Cattle | 2,500 | $8,000 |
| D. Fish | 7,500 | $10,000 |

**Student Activities:**
- Q1: System design with calculations (7 pts, manual - highest value!)
- Q2: Efficiency justification (6 pts, manual)
- Q3: Trade-off analysis (4 pts, manual)
- Q4: Scale-up solution (4 pts, auto-graded)
- Q5: Real-world diet impact (4 pts, auto-graded)

**Sample Solution:**
- 40 hectares vegetables: 40 × 50,000 = 2,000,000 kcal ✓
- Cost: 40 × $2,000 = $80,000 (under budget!)
- Remaining 60 hectares + $420,000 for protein variety

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality | Address At |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| "Energy is recycled like matter" | Energy flows ONE WAY; only matter cycles | Hook, Station 1 |
| "Decomposers recycle energy" | Decomposers release energy as heat; they recycle MATTER | Station 1 Q2 |
| "Top predators are stronger so they need more energy" | They have LESS energy available, which limits their population | Station 2 |
| "Energy pyramids are always stable" | Disruptions cascade through levels | Exit Ticket |

## Formative Assessment Checkpoints

### During Hook (Minute 8)
**Check:** Can students identify that producers outnumber consumers?
**Indicator:** Q1 auto-grade shows >80% correct
**Response:** If <80%, pause for whole-class discussion before moving on

### During Station 1 (Minute 20)
**Check:** Are students applying 10% rule correctly?
**Indicator:** Listen for "multiply by 0.10" or "divide by 10"
**Response:** If struggling, model one calculation on board

### During Station 2 (Minute 35)
**Check:** Can students calculate with the conversion factor?
**Indicator:** Q2 responses show work (40,000 × 5 = 200,000)
**Response:** If struggling, provide scaffolded template

### During Station 3 (Minute 55)
**Check:** Are designs meeting constraints?
**Indicator:** Students reaching 2,000,000 kcal target
**Response:** Prompt: "Check your math - are you feeding 1,000 people?"

## Cycle 3 → Cycle 4 Explicit Connections

Make these connections EXPLICIT during instruction:

| When | Say This |
|------|----------|
| Hook Q3 | "Remember how natural selection favors organisms with beneficial traits? Limited energy IS a selection pressure." |
| Station 1 Q5 | "Cycle 3: efficient hunters survive. Cycle 4: that's because energy is scarce at top levels!" |
| Exit Ticket Q5 | "This is the BIG connection: 10% rule CREATES selection pressure for energy efficiency." |

## Week 2 Preview

**Teaser for Next Week:** "You designed an efficient farm. But what happens when an invasive species disrupts the whole energy pyramid?"

**Coming Up:** The Cane Toad Disaster - How one species destroyed Australia's food web

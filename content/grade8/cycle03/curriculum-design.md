| Persistent Misconception | Frequency | Cycle 3 Integration Point |
|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Larger objects exert more force | ~55% of responses | Predator-prey force interactions |

## Week 1: The Cheetah-Gazelle Arms Race

**Phenomenon:** "If cheetahs are the fastest land animal, why haven't gazelles gone extinct?"

### NGSS Alignment

**Performance Expectation:** MS-LS4-4
> Construct an explanation based on evidence that describes how genetic variations of traits in a population increase some individuals' probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific environment.

**3D Integration:**
- **DCI:** LS4.B (Natural Selection)
- **SEP:** Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
- **CCC:** Cause and Effect; Stability and Change

### Learning Targets

By the end of Week 1, students will be able to:
1. Apply Newton's Third Law to predator-prey interactions
2. Explain how trait variation leads to differential survival
3. Calculate acceleration differences using F=ma
4. Design an organism optimized for survival using physics principles

### Station 1: Predator-Prey Force Analysis (INTERLEAVED RETRIEVAL)

**Spiral Target:** Newton's Third Law in biological systems

**Task:** Analyze slow-motion video of cheetah-gazelle chase, focusing on contact/collision
- Identify action-reaction force pairs when cheetah strikes gazelle
- Calculate relative accelerations using F=ma during collision
- **CRITICAL:** "When the cheetah contacts the gazelle, does the cheetah exert more force, or do they exert equal forces?"

**Data Analysis (Collision Scenario):**
- During a 0.2-second collision, cheetah (50 kg) and gazelle (25 kg) exert forces on each other
- Measured: Gazelle accelerates at 20 m/s² away from cheetah
- Calculate force on gazelle: F = ma = 25 kg × 20 m/s² = 500 N
- **KEY:** If forces are equal (Newton's Third Law), what force does the gazelle exert ON the cheetah? (500 N)
- What is the cheetah's acceleration? a = F/m = 500 N / 50 kg = 10 m/s²

**Misconception Trap:** Students who believe "larger animals exert more force" will predict the cheetah exerts greater force. Newton's Third Law requires equal and opposite forces—the smaller gazelle experiences GREATER acceleration.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Correctly identify Newton's Third Law in predation
2. Calculate accelerations showing smaller mass = greater acceleration
3. Explain evolutionary advantage of lower mass (evasion)

---

### Station 2: Trait Variation Simulation

**Task:** Use bean simulation to model trait distribution in population
- Different colored beans represent speed variants
- "Hunt" by grabbing beans with timed constraint
- Graph survival rates by trait over "generations"
- **INTERLEAVED:** Explain selection pressure as a "force" (conceptual analogy)

**Success Criteria:**
1. Demonstrate how variation leads to differential survival
2. Calculate change in trait frequency over generations
3. Connect to forces: Selection pressure pushes population toward certain traits

---

### Station 3: Engineering Challenge—Design a Survivor

**Spiral Target:** Apply force concepts to biological design

**Task:** Design an organism to survive a specific predation pressure
- Given constraints: mass budget, energy budget, habitat parameters
- Must justify design using force relationships (F=ma, momentum)
- **INTERLEAVED:** If your organism is smaller, how must it accelerate to escape? Show calculation.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Evidence-based design choices
2. Correct force/acceleration calculations
3. Clear connection between physics principles and survival advantage

## Week 2: Evidence of Evolution & Adaptation

**Phenomenon:** "Why do whale flippers have finger bones?"

### Station 1: Homologous Structures Analysis

**Task:** Compare skeletal structures across species
- Identify common bone patterns in whale flipper, bat wing, human arm
- Draw phylogenetic tree showing common ancestor
- **INTERLEAVED:** Calculate force transmission through bone structures using lever arm analysis

### Station 2: Fossil Record Investigation

**Task:** Analyze progression of horse evolution fossils
- Measure changes in leg bone length, tooth structure
- Graph changes over geological time
- **INTERLEAVED:** Calculate: How does leg length change affect running speed? (v = d/t)

**Resource:** Horse evolution fossil series (Hyracotherium → Mesohippus → Merychippus → Equus)

### Station 3: Engineering Challenge—Reverse Engineer an Adaptation

**Task:** Given an organism's habitat, reverse-engineer its likely adaptations
- Must use physics principles to justify predictions
- Compare predictions to actual organism
- Reflect: What environmental "forces" drove these adaptations?

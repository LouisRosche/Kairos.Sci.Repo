5. **Exit Ticket Page** - Exit Ticket form only

**Assignment Settings:**
- Points: By form (total 100 for week)
- Submission: External tool (Google Forms LTI)
- Available: Dec 1 at 12:00am
- Due: Dec 19 at 11:59pm (forgiving policy)

### Digital Resources (100% Material-Free)

| Station | Materials | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Chromebooks for video | 1 per student |
| 1 | Slow-mo cheetah video | Embedded in student page |
| 1 | Calculator app | On Chromebooks |
| 1 | F=ma reference | Embedded in student page |
| 2 | Natural selection simulation | PhET or equivalent digital simulation |
| 2 | Timer | On Chromebooks |
| 2 | Data table | Embedded in Google Form |
| 3 | Design constraint options | Embedded in Google Form |
| 3 | Digital drawing/design tool | Google Drawings or form sketch |

### Physical Materials
- [ ] Notecards (1 per student for exit ticket notes)

> **Note:** This lesson is designed for 100% material-free digital instruction. The bean simulation has been replaced with the PhET Natural Selection simulation (https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/natural-selection). All design work is completed digitally through Google Forms and Drawings.

## Daily Schedules

### Tuesday, December 2 (65 min) — Period 3 & 5

| Time | Activity | Teacher Actions |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Entry + Settle | Display phenomenon question; Chromebooks open |
| 0:05-0:15 | Hook Form | Independent completion |
| 0:15-0:17 | Transition | Assign groups; distribute materials |
| 0:17-0:37 | Station 1 | Watch for N3L misconceptions |
| 0:37-0:40 | Pomodoro Break | Movement; water |
| 0:40-0:60 | Station 2 | Ensure accurate data collection |
| 0:60-0:65 | Wrap + Preview | "Tomorrow: Design your own survivor" |

**Station 1 Probing Questions:**
- "When the cheetah hits the gazelle, who pushes harder?"
- "What does Newton's Third Law say about that?"
- "If forces are equal, why does the gazelle move more?"
- "How does mass affect acceleration?"

**Station 2 Probing Questions:**
- "Which color survived best? Why?"
- "What was the 'selection pressure' in this simulation?"
- "Did individual beans change color, or did the population change?"

### Wednesday, December 3 (45 min) — Period 3 & 5

| Time | Activity | Teacher Actions |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0:00-0:03 | Entry + Review | "What happened to trait frequency in the bean sim?" |
| 0:03-0:08 | Station 3 Setup | Distribute constraint cards; explain requirements |
| 0:08-0:38 | Station 3 | Require F=ma calculations |
| 0:38-0:43 | Share Out | 2-3 groups present; class evaluates physics reasoning |
| 0:43-0:45 | Preview | "Friday: Exit ticket to show mastery" |

**Station 3 Probing Questions:**
- "What's your organism's mass? Why?"
- "Show me the F=ma calculation for escape acceleration"
- "What's the trade-off with being smaller?"

---

### Friday, December 5 (65 min) — Period 3 & 5

| Time | Activity | Teacher Actions |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Entry | Display: "Final day of Week 1" |
| 0:05-0:10 | Quick Review | 3 rapid-fire questions verbally |
| 0:10-0:35 | Exit Ticket | Independent form completion |
| 0:35-0:40 | Break | Movement break |

## Real-Time Monitoring

### Misconception Watch List

| Misconception | Student Says/Does | Intervention |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "Cheetah exerts more force" | "It's bigger and stronger" | Write F₁ = -F₂; have them explain N3L |
| "Individual beans changed" | "This bean got faster" | Emphasize POPULATION vs individual change |
| "Bigger is always better" | "Large animals survive" | Return to a = F/m calculation |

### End of Each Day

1. Open Google Forms response summary
2. Check completion rate (target: >80%)
3. Scan short answers for misconception patterns
4. Flag students with 0 submissions for follow-up

## Differentiation Quick-Reference

### More Support
- Pair with stronger partner
- Sentence frames: "Natural selection works because ___"
- Allow verbal responses recorded on phone
- Extended time (async by cycle end)

### More Challenge
- "Design a second organism that competes with your first"
- Calculate momentum changes during predation
- Research actual adaptation examples

### ELL Students
- Vocabulary glossary: selection pressure, trait, variation, acceleration, force
- Partner with bilingual peer
- Accept diagrams for partial credit

## Answer Keys

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| N3L force comparison | Forces are EQUAL (500 N each) |
| Cheetah acceleration | 500N ÷ 50kg = 10 m/s² |
| Gazelle acceleration | 500N ÷ 25kg = 20 m/s² |
| F=ma exit ticket | 20N ÷ 4kg = 5 m/s² |
| Survival calculation | 720 fast ÷ 820 total = 87.8% ≈ 88% fast |

---

## Emergency Backup Plans

### If Chromebooks fail:
- Print video screenshots with force diagrams
- Bean simulation works without tech
- Station 3 works without tech
- Paper Exit Ticket in emergency folder

### If internet is down:
- Bean simulation requires no internet
- Have paper forms ready

### If time runs short:
- Priority: Hook + Station 1 + Exit Ticket
- Stations 2-3 can be completed async
- **Never skip Exit Ticket**

## End-of-Week Checklist

- [ ] Export all form responses to spreadsheets
- [ ] Run IMPORTRANGE formulas in hub
- [ ] Sync scores to Canvas gradebook
- [ ] Review Exit Ticket data
- [ ] Identify students <50% completion → Monday follow-up
- [ ] Note misconception patterns for Week 2

## Week 1 Rubrics

### Station 1: Misconception Check
**SEP:** Analyzing Data | **DCI:** PS2.A | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** When a 50 kg cheetah contacts a 25 kg gazelle during a chase, compare the forces.
**Correct Answer:** c) Forces are equal

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies forces as EQUAL + invokes N3L + may note different accelerations | "The forces are equal (Newton's Third Law: for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction). Even though the cheetah is bigger, both exert the same force. The ACCELERATIONS are different—the smaller gazelle accelerates more." |
| **3** | Correctly identifies forces as equal + mentions N3L | "The forces are equal because of Newton's Third Law." |
| **2** | Correctly identifies forces as equal but no explanation | "They're the same force." |
| **1** | Incorrect - states larger animal exerts more force | "The cheetah exerts more force because it's bigger." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Answer (a) "Cheetah exerts more" → MOST COMMON ERROR. Conflates force with size. Remediate with paired object demos.
- Answer (b) "Gazelle exerts more" → Rare. May be random guessing.
- Answer (d) "Can't determine" → Conflating force with acceleration; lacks N3L confidence.

### Station 1: Calculation Verification

**Questions:** Force (500N expected), Cheetah acceleration, Gazelle acceleration

| Score | Criteria | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **4** | All three correct: Force = 500N, Cheetah a = 10 m/s², Gazelle a = 20 m/s² | Full credit |
| **3** | Two of three correct OR all with minor arithmetic errors | Partial credit |
| **2** | One correct OR correct setup with execution errors | Needs calculation support |
| **1** | Incorrect setup but some relevant physics vocabulary | Needs conceptual review |
| **0** | No response or completely incorrect | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Force ≠ 500N → Didn't apply N3L correctly; thinks forces unequal
- Cheetah acceleration > gazelle → Inverted relationship; review a = F/m
- Wrong units → Review dimensional analysis

### Station 1: Evolutionary Insight
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** LS4.B | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Based on your calculations, why might being SMALLER give prey an advantage during predator contact?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Connects lower mass → higher acceleration + survival advantage + uses F=ma | "From F=ma, if force is equal but mass is smaller, acceleration is greater (a=F/m). So when predator and prey collide, smaller prey gets pushed away FASTER, giving more distance to escape. This is why many prey evolved smaller sizes." |
| **3** | Connects lower mass → higher acceleration + mentions survival | "Smaller animals accelerate faster when hit with same force, so they escape better." |
| **2** | Mentions acceleration or escape but connection incomplete | "Smaller is faster." |
| **1** | Incorrect reasoning | "Smaller animals can hide better." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 2: Lamarckian Misconception Check

**Question:** After the simulation, why did the population change?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Explains differential survival without individual change | "More of one color survived because they were harder to catch. The individuals didn't change—more of them survived to reproduce." |
| **3** | Correct explanation but less precise | "The camouflaged ones survived better." |
| **2** | Partially correct | "Some beans were better." |
| **1** | Lamarckian misconception | "The beans learned to avoid being caught." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP 6 + DCI LS4.B + CCC Cause and Effect**

**Question:** Predict what will happen to brown/green insects over 100 generations with a new visual predator. Explain using both natural selection AND physics concepts.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Correct prediction + natural selection mechanism + physics connection + quantitative | "Over 100 generations, the better-camouflaged color will increase in frequency. Predators exert 'selection pressure'—like a force pushing the population toward certain traits. Insects that blend in survive to reproduce. Physics: Smaller/faster insects (higher a=F/m) might also escape, so speed traits might also be selected." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Correct prediction + mechanism + physics (weaker integration) | "The color that blends in will become more common because predators catch visible ones. It's like a force selecting traits." |
| **2** | ~SEP ✓DCI ✗CCC | Correct prediction + natural selection OR physics (not both) | "Green insects will die if tree is brown, so brown becomes common." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Correct prediction but no mechanism OR incorrect | "They'll all turn brown eventually." (Lamarckian) |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 Lamarckian: "Insects will change their color to survive" → Individual adaptation misconception; emphasize POPULATION change
- Score 2 physics-only: Focus on escape without inheritance → Connect physics TO inheritance
- Score 3 analogy-only: Uses "force" metaphor but doesn't quantify → Push for numerical prediction

## Week 2 Rubrics

### Hook Q2: Initial Hypothesis (3 pts)
**Question:** Why might a whale have finger bones inside its flipper? Propose a hypothesis.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Proposes common ancestor or evolutionary origin | "Whales evolved from land mammals with arms and fingers. Over millions of years, natural selection reshaped arms into flippers, but the bone pattern was inherited from the ancestor." |
| **2** | Reasonable hypothesis with some logic | "Whales evolved from animals that had fingers. The bones stayed but changed shape." |
| **1** | Vague guess | "Maybe whales used to walk." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Hook Q4: Week 1 Connection (3 pts)
**Question:** How does natural selection explain why whale flippers look different from human hands, even though they have the same bones?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Connects to natural selection AND population-level change | "Different environments = different selection pressures. Whales with paddle-like limbs caught more fish and survived better. Over generations, the POPULATION developed flippers. Humans with flexible hands survived better for tool use." |
| **2** | Mentions Week 1 concepts but unclear connection | "Different environments caused different selection pressures." |
| **1** | Vague response | "They live in different places." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 1 Q3: Evidence Interpretation (5 pts)
**Question:** What does shared bone pattern in whales, bats, dogs, and humans suggest about evolutionary history?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Common ancestor + bone modification over time | "They share a COMMON ANCESTOR with this arm structure. Natural selection modified bones for different functions: flippers, wings, running legs, hands. Same structure, different function = HOMOLOGOUS." |
| **4** | Mentions common ancestor correctly | "They evolved from the same ancestor. The bones got shaped differently for different uses." |
| **3** | Partial explanation | "They share common ancestry." |
| **2** | Vague response | "They're all related." |
| **1** | Incorrect | "They all have bones because they're all animals." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 1 Q5: Week 1 Spiral - Natural Selection (3 pts)
**Question:** Use natural selection to explain how the same ancestral arm became flipper (whales), wing (bats), and digging claw (moles).

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Correctly applies natural selection mechanism | "Variation existed in population. In water, paddle-like limbs caught more food → those individuals survived and reproduced → over generations, flippers became common. Same logic for wings and claws in different environments." |
| **2** | Mentions selection but incomplete mechanism | "Different environments selected for different shapes. Whales needed flippers to swim." |
| **1** | Vague connection | "They adapted to their environments." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**RED FLAG:** "They adapted" without mechanism = push for HOW (variation → selection → reproduction → population change)

---

### Station 2 Q3: Predict Intermediate Fossil (5 pts)
**Question:** Predict features of a fossil from 49.5 million years ago (between Pakicetus and Ambulocetus).

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Intermediate structure AND habitat/behavior | "Legs: Shorter than Pakicetus, with early webbing. Feet: Starting to become paddle-like. Tail: Getting longer/more muscular. Habitat: Lived on land but spent more time in shallow water than Pakicetus." |
| **4** | Intermediate structure OR habitat | One category detailed, other mentioned |
| **3** | Reasonable prediction with less detail | "Four legs with some webbing, lived near water." |
| **2** | Vague prediction | "Halfway between them." |
| **1** | No scientific reasoning | Just names features without intermediate logic |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 2 Q4: Evidence Evaluation (4 pts)
**Question:** Respond to "There are no transitional fossils - evolution has no evidence."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Refutes with specific fossil evidence | "Wrong! Whale fossils show gradual transition: Pakicetus (4 legs) → Ambulocetus (walk AND swim) → Basilosaurus (tiny legs) → modern whales. Each fossil is intermediate between ancestor and descendant." |
| **3** | Refutes with general fossil evidence | "There ARE transitional fossils. Ambulocetus had both legs AND swimming adaptations." |
| **2** | Recognizes claim is wrong but weak evidence | "There are fossils that show evolution." |
| **1** | Accepts the claim | Agrees with misconception |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3 Q1: Limb Design (5 pts)
**Question:** Describe LIMBS of your transitional organism (60 mya). Ancestor had 4 legs, descendant has flippers.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Intermediate limbs + selection pressure explained | "Front: Shorter than ancestor, wider with webbing for paddling. Back: Smaller but visible, paddle-like feet. Selection: More paddle-like limbs = better fishing = more offspring." |
| **4** | Intermediate limbs with partial explanation | Describes intermediate features without selection pressure |
| **3** | Reasonable intermediate design | "Shorter legs with webbed feet, good for both environments." |
| **2** | Either fully land OR fully aquatic | "Flippers" (that's descendant, not transitional) |
| **1** | No scientific basis | Random guess |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3 Q2: Body Covering Design (5 pts)
**Question:** Describe BODY COVERING. Ancestor had fur, descendant has smooth skin.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Intermediate covering + selective advantage | "Sparse, short fur—enough insulation on land but less drag in water. Over time, individuals with less fur swam faster and caught more food, so fur became sparser." |
| **4** | Intermediate covering with partial explanation | Describes intermediate but no selection explanation |
| **3** | Reasonable intermediate design | "Thin, short fur, somewhat waterproof." |
| **2** | Fully furred OR fully smooth | Not intermediate |
| **1** | No scientific basis | "Some fur" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3 Q3: Behavior and Habitat (5 pts)
**Question:** Describe HABITAT and BEHAVIOR. Where did it live? What did it eat? How did it move?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Intermediate habitat + specific behaviors + explains why | "Coastal/shallow water. Ate fish by chasing in water. Swam with paddle-feet (awkward but effective), waddled on land (like seals). Needed both environments—water for food, land for rest/reproduction." |
| **4** | Intermediate habitat and behaviors | Describes both without explaining why |
| **3** | Reasonable intermediate lifestyle | "Lived near coast, ate fish, could swim and walk." |
| **2** | Either fully land OR fully water | "In the ocean" (that's descendant) |
| **1** | No scientific basis | Random |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3 Q4: Natural Selection Explanation (7 pts)
**Question:** Using NATURAL SELECTION, explain how transitional form evolves into fully aquatic descendant.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **7** | Complete mechanism: variation → selection → survival/reproduction → population change | "1) VARIATION: Some born with shorter legs, more webbing. 2) SELECTION: Ocean favored better swimmers. 3) SURVIVAL: Those with aquatic traits caught more food, reproduced more. 4) INHERITANCE: Genes for aquatic features spread. 5) POPULATION changed over millions of years. KEY: Individuals didn't change—population did." |
| **5** | Most elements of natural selection | Mentions variation, selection, reproduction but incomplete |
| **3** | Partial mechanism | "Better swimmers survived and had babies" |
| **1** | No mechanism, just "it evolved" | "They changed to survive in water." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**RED FLAG:** "They changed to survive" = Lamarckian. POPULATION changed because individuals WITH traits survived.

### Exit Ticket Q1: Define Homologous Structures (4 pts)
**Question:** Define HOMOLOGOUS STRUCTURES, give example, explain why it's evidence for evolution.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Definition + example + evidence explanation | "Same STRUCTURE, different FUNCTION. Example: whale flipper and human arm have same bones (humerus, radius, ulna, digits) but used for swimming vs. grabbing. Evidence: If they evolved separately, they wouldn't have identical bone patterns. Shared structure = common ancestor." |
| **3** | Correct definition + example | "Same structure, different function. Like whale flippers and human arms have the same bones." |
| **2** | Partial definition | "Body parts that are similar" |
| **1** | Confused with analogous | "Body parts that do the same thing" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Exit Ticket Q5: Integration (3D)
**SEP 6 + DCI LS4.B + CCC Patterns**

**Question:** Respond to "Evolution is just a guess - there's no real evidence."

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Uses Week 1 natural selection + Week 2 anatomical/fossil evidence | "WRONG! Week 1: We SAW natural selection in simulations. Week 2: Homologous structures (same bones, different functions) prove common ancestry. Transitional fossils (Pakicetus → Ambulocetus → modern whales) show evolution in action. Multiple lines of evidence converge on same conclusion." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Uses one type of evidence well | "We have evidence: homologous structures show common ancestry, and transitional fossils show evolution happening." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Mentions both but doesn't connect | "There are fossils and bones." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Vague response | "There is evidence." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

---

### Exit Ticket Q6: Dolphin/Shark Explanation (3 pts)
**Question:** How can dolphins (mammals) and sharks (fish) look so similar?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Clear explanation with evidence + mechanism | "ANALOGOUS structures: same FUNCTION (swimming) but different STRUCTURE (dolphins = bones, warm blood; sharks = cartilage, cold blood). Convergent evolution: both evolved streamlined shapes independently because that's what works for swimming. Similar appearance ≠ common ancestor." |
| **2** | Explanation with partial evidence | "They evolved similar shapes independently. Analogous structures." |
| **1** | Vague explanation | "They're both streamlined for swimming." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Quick Reference: Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Probing Question |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Bigger animals exert more force | Forces are always equal (N3L) | "What does Newton's Third Law say?" |
| Only moving objects exert forces | All objects can exert forces | "What force does the floor exert on you?" |
| Evolution = individual change | Evolution = population change | "Does the mouse get faster, or do faster mice survive?" |

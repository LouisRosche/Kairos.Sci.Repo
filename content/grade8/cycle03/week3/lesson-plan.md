## Grading Guide

### Part 1: Synthesis (20 pts)

| Q | Points | Key Elements |
|---|--------|--------------|
| Q1 | 5 | Explains how natural selection on ancestors produced whale flipper bones |
| Q2 | 5 | Identifies transitional fossils as best evidence |
| Q3 | 5 | Applies natural selection to Tiktaalik with variation + selection + inheritance |
| Q4 | 5 | Connects N3L forces to survival advantage |

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (60 pts)

| Section | Points | Learning Targets Assessed |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|
| A: Natural Selection | 15 | W1-1 (mechanism), W1-2 (F=ma), W1-4 (populations) |
| B: Evolutionary Evidence | 15 | W2-1 (homologous), W2-3 (transitional), vestigial |
| C: Synthesis | 15 | W1+W2 connection, predict transitional features |
| D: Constructing Explanations | 15 | SEP-6 with evidence, mechanism, generations |

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 pts)

| Q | Points | Misconception Targeted |
|---|--------|------------------------|
| MC1a | 5 | Lamarckian (stretching changes genes) |
| MC1b | 5 | Correct mechanism (existing variation) |
| MC2a | 5 | N3L ("bigger = more force") |
| MC2b | 5 | F=ma (same force, different acceleration) |

---

## Answer Key Highlights

### Part 1
- **Q1:** Natural selection modified existing limb bones over generations; those with flipper-like variations swam better
- **Q2:** Transitional fossils (NOT behavior similarities)
- **Q4:** Faster acceleration = escape predators = survive to reproduce

### Part 2
- **A1:** Variation must exist AND affect survival/reproduction
- **A3:** Gazelle accelerates faster (less mass, same force, a=F/m)
- **B1:** Analogous (different structure, same function)
- **B3:** Vestigial structures (reduced features from ancestors)
- **C3:** Mix of ancestral and descendant features

### Part 3
- **MC1a:** NO - stretching doesn't change DNA (most missed question)
- **MC1b:** Variation already existed → long-necked giraffes survived better
- **MC2a:** Equal and opposite (size doesn't matter!)
- **MC2b:** Same F, smaller m = larger a

## Data Analysis Plan

### After Assessment
1. Export all responses to spreadsheet
2. Calculate question-level percentages
3. Flag any question with <60% correct
4. Identify students <70% total → intervention list

### Misconception Tracking
| Misconception | Threshold | Action if > Threshold |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Lamarckian | >30% wrong | Cycle 4 re-teach |
| N3L size myth | >25% wrong | Cycle 4 re-teach |
| Homologous/analogous | >20% wrong | Quick review |

### Report to Generate
- Class average by section (A, B, C, D)
- Learning target mastery rates
- Misconception persistence rates
- Comparison to W1 and W2 exit tickets

## Exemplar Responses

### Part 1 Q1 (Whale flipper explanation) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> Natural selection works on existing variation, not by creating new traits. In the ancestral population, some individuals had limb variations slightly better suited for swimming. Those with more paddle-like limbs caught more food and escaped predators better, surviving to reproduce. Their offspring inherited the limb variation. Over millions of years, this process continued, each generation slightly more flipper-like. The BONES stayed the same (humerus, radius, ulna, digits) because natural selection modifies existing structures rather than starting from scratch.

**Partial (3/5):**
> Whales evolved flippers because they needed to swim. The bones stayed the same because they came from ancestors.

### Part 2 A2 (Beetle population) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> 1. VARIATION: The population has beetles ranging from light to dark brown
> 2. SELECTION: Birds eat light beetles more easily (more visible on dark bark)
> 3. SURVIVAL: Dark beetles survive longer and reproduce more
> 4. INHERITANCE: Dark beetle genes passed to offspring
> 5. POPULATION CHANGE: After 50 generations, most beetles will be dark brown
>
> The population evolved, not individual beetles "turning" dark.

### Part 2 D1 (Whale evolution explanation) - 10 points

**Exemplar (10/10):**
> EVIDENCE FOR WHALE EVOLUTION FROM LAND MAMMALS:
>
> 1. **Transitional fossils:** Pakicetus (50 MYA) had 4 legs but whale-like inner ear bones. Ambulocetus (48 MYA) could walk AND swim. Rodhocetus (46 MYA) had smaller legs and larger tail. Basilosaurus (37 MYA) was fully aquatic with vestigial tiny legs.
>
> 2. **Homologous structures:** Modern whale flippers contain the same bones as human arms (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, digits) - showing common ancestry with land mammals.
>
> 3. **Vestigial structures:** Modern whales have hip bones deep inside their bodies, even though they have no legs. These are leftovers from walking ancestors.
>
> MECHANISM (Natural Selection):
> In ancestral populations, individuals with limb variations better suited for swimming survived better in water environments. Those with more streamlined bodies and paddle-like limbs caught more fish and escaped predators. They reproduced more, passing genes to offspring. This occurred over MILLIONS of generations, not within any individual whale's lifetime.

### Part 3 MC1b (Correct giraffe explanation) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> In an ancestral giraffe population, there was variation in neck length - some were born with slightly longer necks, some with shorter necks. During droughts when low leaves were eaten, giraffes with longer necks could reach higher food and survived better. They reproduced more, passing the "long neck" genes to offspring. Short-necked giraffes starved more often and had fewer offspring. Over thousands of generations, the AVERAGE neck length in the population increased. No individual giraffe "grew" a longer neck - the population changed through differential survival.

## Spiral Check: Cycle 2 → Cycle 3

Students should show improvement on these spiraled concepts:

| Concept | Cycle 2 Source | Week 1 Check | Week 3 Check |
|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Newton's 3rd Law | MS-PS2-1 | Hook Q4 | MC2a |
| F=ma | MS-PS2-2 | Station 2 | A3, MC2b |
| Equal/opposite forces | N3L unit | Station 2 | MC2a |

If class average on spiral questions is <70%, plan reteach for Cycle 4.

## Misconception Remediation Scripts

### Lamarckian Misconception (Group A)

**Opening:** "Let me show you something. Everyone, make a fist. Squeeze as hard as you can for 30 seconds. [wait] Okay, now imagine you did that every day for your whole life. Your hands would get stronger, right? But here's the key question: Would your CHILDREN be born with stronger hands?"

**Key Point:** "Your body doesn't change your DNA. The genes you pass to your children are the same genes you were born with. You can't pass on changes you made to your own body."

**Apply to Evolution:** "So how DID giraffes get long necks? Some baby giraffes were born with slightly longer necks - random variation in the genes. Those reached more food, survived, had babies. Their babies inherited the 'long neck' genes. The population changed, not individual giraffes."

### N3L Misconception (Group C)

**Opening:** "I'm going to push against this wall. Is the wall pushing back on me? [Yes] Now, who is pushing harder - me or the wall?"

**Reveal:** "EQUAL. Always equal. Newton's 3rd Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The wall pushes on me with EXACTLY the same force I push on it."

**The Confusion:** "But wait - if an elephant pushes on a mouse, and they push equally, why does the mouse go flying? Same force, different MASS. F=ma → a=F/m. Same F, tiny m = HUGE acceleration. Same F, huge m = tiny acceleration."

**Apply to Evolution:** "This matters for survival! A small animal that can push hard has a bigger advantage than a large animal pushing the same amount. Physics determines what traits help you survive."

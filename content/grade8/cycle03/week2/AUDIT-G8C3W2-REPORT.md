## 1. VALIDITY AUDIT (Scientific Accuracy)

### Findings: PASS

#### Verified Accurate Content:
- **Whale Evolution Sequence** ✅
  - Pakicetus (50 mya) → Ambulocetus (49 mya) → Rodhocetus (47 mya) → Basilosaurus (40 mya) → Modern whales
  - Dates and features align with paleontological consensus (Gingerich et al., 2001; Thewissen et al., 2007)

- **Homologous Structures Definition** ✅
  - "Same bone structure, different function" - Correct
  - Examples: Whale flipper, bat wing, human arm, dog leg - All share pentadactyl limb pattern

- **Analogous Structures Definition** ✅
  - "Different structure, same function" - Correct
  - Example: Bird wing vs butterfly wing - Correctly identified as convergent evolution

- **Transitional Fossil Examples** ✅
  - Tiktaalik (fish → tetrapod, 375 mya) - Accurate
  - Archaeopteryx (dinosaur → bird, 150 mya) - Accurate
  - Ambulocetus ("walking whale", 49 mya) - Accurate

- **Natural Selection Mechanism** ✅
  - Correctly emphasizes: Variation exists → Selection pressure → Differential survival/reproduction → Population change
  - Correctly identifies and targets Lamarckian misconception

- **Bone Pattern (Pentadactyl Limb)** ✅
  - Humerus → Radius/Ulna → Carpals → Digits (5)
  - Correctly applied across mammals

#### Minor Note:
- Bird digits shown as 3 in simulation - This is scientifically accurate (modern birds have 3 functional digits in wing)

## 4. SEQUENCE AUDIT (Logical Progression)

### Findings: PASS

#### Learning Progression:

```
Hook (Observation)
    │ "Why do whale flippers have finger bones?"
    │ Activates prior knowledge, creates cognitive dissonance
    ▼
Station 1 (Classification)
    │ Homologous vs Analogous structures
    │ Introduces vocabulary and classification skills
    ▼
Station 2 (Evidence Analysis)
    │ Fossil record investigation
    │ Applies concepts to temporal data
    ▼
Station 3 (Application/Design)
    │ Design a transitional form
    │ Highest cognitive demand - synthesis and creation
    ▼
Exit Ticket (Integration)
    │ Connects all evidence types
    │ Spirals Week 1 + Week 2 content
    └─► Week 3: Synthesis & Assessment
```

#### Cognitive Load Progression:
- Hook: Remember/Understand (observe, hypothesize)
- S1: Understand/Apply (classify, compare)
- S2: Analyze (interpret patterns, predict)
- S3: Create/Evaluate (design, justify)
- Exit: Evaluate/Synthesize (integrate multiple lines of evidence)

**Alignment with Bloom's Taxonomy: ✅ EXCELLENT**

---

## 5. PRECISION AUDIT (Terminology Accuracy)

### Findings: PASS (after fix)

#### Verified Terminology:

| Term | Definition in Content | Scientific Accuracy |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Homologous Structures | Same bone structure, different function | ✅ Correct |
| Analogous Structures | Different structure, same function | ✅ Correct |
| Transitional Fossil | Features of both ancestral and descendant groups | ✅ Correct |
| Vestigial Structure | Reduced or non-functional structure from ancestors | ✅ Correct |
| Common Ancestor | Ancestral species from which multiple species evolved | ✅ Correct |

#### Issue Fixed:
- **student-page.html line 28**: Changed "MS-LS4-4 Evidence of Common Ancestry" to "MS-LS4-2 & MS-LS4-4 Evidence of Evolution"
  - Rationale: MS-LS4-4 is about genetic variation and survival probability; MS-LS4-2 is specifically about anatomical similarities. Both are covered.

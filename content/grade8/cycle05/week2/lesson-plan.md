# Grade 8 Cycle 5 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Waves & Material Interactions

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS4-2 (Primary), MS-LS2-3 & MS-LS4-4 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Signal Blocker Mystery**
You're in a building and your cell phone shows full bars. Walk into an elevator—signal gone. Move to a room with thick concrete walls—one bar. Go outside near metal fencing—signal varies wildly. Your phone uses invisible waves to communicate, but those waves can't go everywhere.

**Driving Question:** Why do some materials block cell signals while others don't?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain why different materials affect waves differently
2. Quantify transmission, absorption, and reflection for various materials
3. Describe how digital information is encoded in waves
4. Design communication systems considering material interactions

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What determines how waves interact with materials?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Cell signal test through various materials
- **Driving Question:** Why do some materials block signals while others don't?
- **Week 1 Connection:** "We learned about wave properties. How do those properties affect transmission?"
- **Materials:** Cell phone with signal meter, test materials (foil, cardboard, glass, fabric)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on wave behavior vocabulary (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Demonstrate signal strength change with different barriers
- Metal (aluminum foil) blocks effectively
- Glass transmits partially
- Cardboard has minimal effect
- "What's different about these materials at the atomic level?"

### Station 1: Transmission-Absorption Lab (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Quantify how materials affect wave transmission
- **Activity:** Measure light intensity through various materials
- **Key Vocabulary:** Transmission, absorption, opacity, transparency, translucency
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy transfer in ecosystems (Cycle 4)

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Set up light source at consistent distance
2. Place material sample between source and sensor
3. Record light intensity reading
4. Calculate percentage transmitted
5. Repeat for 5+ materials
6. Graph results and identify patterns

**Data Collection Table:**
| Material | Intensity (no barrier) | Intensity (with barrier) | % Transmitted | % Absorbed/Reflected |
|----------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Air | 100% | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Glass | 100% | ? | ? | ? |
| Paper | 100% | ? | ? | ? |
| Fabric | 100% | ? | ? | ? |
| Aluminum | 100% | ? | ? | ? |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Dark materials absorb all waves" | Color relates to visible light only; radio waves unaffected | Test signal through dark vs light materials |
| "Thick materials always block more" | Transmission depends on material type, not just thickness | Compare thin metal to thick cardboard |
| "Waves are either blocked or not" | Transmission is a spectrum; partial absorption common | Measure graduated light through materials |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Material structure and wave interaction
- **Model:** Why metals reflect radio waves but not X-rays
- **Think-Aloud:** "What's happening at the atomic level when a wave hits a material?"
- **Visual:** Atomic structure diagrams with wave interactions

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Free electrons in metals reflect radio/microwave
2. Dense materials absorb more energy
3. Wavelength relative to atomic spacing matters
4. Same material can transmit one wave type, block another

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Why do metals block cell signals but not X-rays?"
- Review transmission percentage data
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Information Encoding Investigation (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** How waves carry digital information
- **Activity:** Binary/wave encoding demo + decoding challenge
- **Spiral Connection:** Information transfer in living systems (Cycle 3)

**Encoding Exploration:**
1. Understand binary code (0s and 1s)
2. Observe how amplitude/frequency can represent binary
3. Encode a simple message using wave patterns
4. Decode a partner's message
5. Discuss how errors occur in transmission

**Digital Signal Concepts:**
| Concept | Description | Application |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Binary | 0 and 1 represent all data | Foundation of digital |
| Amplitude shift | High/low amplitude = 1/0 | Simple encoding |
| Frequency shift | Different frequencies = 1/0 | FM radio principle |
| Phase shift | Wave timing shift = 1/0 | Modern cell signals |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why is digital (binary) more reliable than analog signals?
2. How do noise and interference affect digital vs analog?
3. Why do we need protocols for data transmission?

### Station 3: Design a Communication System (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply wave-material knowledge to real communication problem
- **Activity:** Design communication system for specific constraints
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-3 (Planning Investigations) + SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations)

**Design Challenge:**
A research station in Antarctica needs to communicate with the main base 50 km away. Between them: ice fields, a mountain range, and a research plane flying overhead. Design a reliable communication system.

**Design Constraints:**
1. Must work in extreme cold (-40°C)
2. Limited power available (solar/battery only)
3. Mountains may block direct line of sight
4. Backup system required

**Design Plan Must Include:**
1. Primary communication method (wave type, frequency)
2. How to handle mountain obstruction (relay, satellite, diffraction)
3. Backup system for emergencies
4. Power requirements and sustainability

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Guide students to consider: radio waves bend around obstacles (diffraction)
- Satellite relay adds delay but provides reliability
- Different frequencies for different purposes
- Connect to real Antarctic research communication

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (material interactions, information encoding)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 4: energy transfer; Week 1: wave properties)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect material properties to communication design)
  - 1 SEP-4 question (Analyze transmission data)

# Grade 8 Cycle 5 Week 1 Lesson Plan

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS4-2 (Primary), MS-LS2-3 & MS-LS4-4 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The WiFi vs Flashlight Mystery**
Your home WiFi signal passes through walls, floors, and furniture to reach your devices in any room. But if you try to shine a flashlight through those same walls, no light gets through. Both WiFi and light are electromagnetic waves—so why do they behave so differently?

**Driving Question:** How can we see through walls with WiFi but not with flashlights?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain that waves transfer energy without transferring matter
2. Describe how wavelength affects wave-material interactions
3. Model reflection, refraction, absorption, and transmission
4. Design investigations to test wave behavior with different materials

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What are waves? Give an everyday example."

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** WiFi signal strength demo + flashlight through wall comparison
- **Driving Question:** How can WiFi pass through walls but light cannot?
- **Prior Knowledge Connection:** "We've studied energy transfer. How might waves carry energy?"
- **Materials:** WiFi signal strength app, flashlight, cardboard barrier
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on energy concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Demonstrate WiFi signal on both sides of a wall/barrier
- Show that visible light doesn't pass through
- Reveal that both are electromagnetic waves—same family!
- "Today we'll discover why waves act so differently"

### Station 1: Wave Tank Investigation (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Observe fundamental wave behaviors (reflection, refraction, diffraction)
- **Activity:** Use ripple tank or simulation to create waves and observe barrier interactions
- **Key Vocabulary:** Wavelength, amplitude, frequency, reflection, refraction, diffraction, transmission
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy transfer concepts from Cycle 4

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Generate waves with consistent frequency
2. Place straight barrier → observe reflection
3. Place gap in barrier → observe diffraction
4. Change wave frequency → compare diffraction patterns
5. Record observations in data table

**Key Observations to Guide:**
| Wave Behavior | Description | Evidence |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Reflection | Wave bounces off barrier | Angle in = angle out |
| Refraction | Wave bends when entering new medium | Direction change at boundary |
| Diffraction | Wave spreads around obstacles | Wider spread with smaller gaps |
| Transmission | Wave passes through material | Reduced amplitude |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Waves push water forward" | Waves transfer energy, not matter | Float a cork—it bobs up/down, doesn't travel |
| "Bigger waves go faster" | Speed depends on medium, not amplitude | Measure speed of different amplitude waves |
| "Waves can only go in one direction" | Waves spread in all directions from source | Point source demonstration |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** The Electromagnetic Spectrum
- **Model:** Range from radio waves to gamma rays
- **Think-Aloud:** "If all EM waves travel at the same speed, what makes them different?"
- **Visual:** EM spectrum wall chart with wavelength/frequency relationship

**Key Points to Model:**
1. All EM waves travel at speed of light in vacuum
2. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related
3. Longer wavelength = more likely to pass through materials
4. WiFi (~12 cm wavelength) vs. visible light (~500 nm wavelength)

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished Station 1 observations
- **Extension:** Research how animals use different wave types (echolocation, infrared sensing)
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on wave concepts

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What happens when waves encounter a barrier? Name 3 behaviors."
- Review wavelength/frequency relationship
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Electromagnetic Spectrum Exploration (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Compare wave types across the EM spectrum
- **Activity:** Use PhET Wave Interference simulation + EM spectrum cards
- **Resource URL:** https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/wave-interference
- **Spiral Connection:** Information transfer in biological systems (Cycle 3)

**Exploration Tasks:**
1. Compare wavelengths of radio, microwave, infrared, visible, UV, X-ray
2. Match wavelength to everyday application (WiFi, microwave oven, TV remote, etc.)
3. Predict which waves will pass through different materials
4. Rank EM waves by energy level

**EM Spectrum Reference:**
| Wave Type | Wavelength | Frequency | Common Use |
|-----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| Radio | 1 km - 1 m | Low | AM/FM radio, WiFi |
| Microwave | 1 m - 1 mm | ↓ | Cell phones, cooking |
| Infrared | 1 mm - 700 nm | ↓ | Remote controls, heat |
| Visible | 700 - 400 nm | ↓ | Human vision |
| Ultraviolet | 400 - 10 nm | ↓ | Sunburn, sterilization |
| X-ray | 10 - 0.01 nm | ↓ | Medical imaging |
| Gamma | < 0.01 nm | High | Cancer treatment |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why can X-rays see through skin but not bone?
2. Why do we use radio waves for communication over long distances?
3. How does wavelength relate to energy?

### Station 3: Design a Wave Barrier (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply wave properties to engineering design problem
- **Activity:** Design a barrier system that blocks some waves while allowing others through
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-2 (Developing Models) + SEP-3 (Planning Investigations)

**Design Challenge:**
A hospital needs to protect sensitive equipment from cell phone signals (microwaves) but still allow emergency radio communication and patient monitoring (infrared).

**Design Requirements:**
1. Block microwave frequencies (cell phones)
2. Allow radio frequencies (emergency communication)
3. Allow infrared (patient monitoring equipment)
4. Must be practical for hospital environment

**Design Plan Must Include:**
1. Material selection with justification
2. Barrier structure (solid, mesh, layers?)
3. Predicted effectiveness for each wave type
4. Trade-offs and limitations

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Guide students to research material properties
- Ask: "What properties of materials affect wave transmission?"
- Connect to structure-function relationship (CCC-6)

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (wave properties, EM spectrum)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 4: energy transfer; Cycle 3: information systems)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect wave behavior to material properties)
  - 1 SEP-2 question (Model wave behavior)

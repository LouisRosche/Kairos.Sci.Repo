## Overview

This cycle explores wave properties and how waves interact with materials, connecting to the essential understanding that information can be encoded and transmitted through wave signals. Students investigate why different types of waves behave differently when encountering various materials, building toward understanding modern communication technologies.

## Driving Phenomena

| Week | Phenomenon | Driving Question |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Week 1 | WiFi signals pass through walls but light doesn't | "How can we see through walls with WiFi but not with flashlights?" |
| Week 2 | Cell phone signals vary based on surroundings | "Why do some materials block cell signals while others don't?" |
| Week 3 | Synthesis & Assessment | Integrated understanding of wave-material interactions |

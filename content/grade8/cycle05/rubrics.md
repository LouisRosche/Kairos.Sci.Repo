## Week 1 Rubrics: Wave Properties & Behavior

### Station 1: Wave Tank Investigation
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** PS4.A | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Describe what happens when a wave encounters a gap in a barrier. How does the gap size affect the result?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Identifies diffraction + size relationship + mechanism | "When waves hit a gap, they spread out (diffract) on the other side. Smaller gaps cause more spreading because the wavelength is larger relative to the gap. The wave bends around the edges of the gap, and if the gap is about the same size as the wavelength, the spreading is maximum." |
| **3** | Identifies diffraction + size relationship | "Waves spread out when they go through gaps. Smaller gaps make them spread more." |
| **2** | Identifies behavior without relationship | "Waves go through the gap and spread out." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "The wave stops at the gap." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: EM Spectrum Exploration
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Structure and Function

**Question:** Why can X-rays see through skin but not bone? Use your understanding of wave properties.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Wavelength + density + atomic interaction | "X-rays have very short wavelengths and high energy. They can pass through soft tissue (skin, muscle) because the atoms are spaced apart. But bone has calcium which is denser with more closely packed atoms, so it absorbs the X-rays. The wavelength matters because it determines how the wave interacts with atomic structure." |
| **3** | Wavelength OR density + partial mechanism | "X-rays go through skin because it's less dense. Bone blocks them because it's solid." |
| **2** | General answer | "Bone is harder than skin." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "X-rays can see through everything." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Design a Wave Barrier
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Design a barrier that blocks cell phone signals but allows radio communication.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Material + mesh size + wavelength reasoning + trade-offs | "Use a metal mesh with holes about 5 cm apart. Cell phone signals (microwaves, ~10 cm wavelength) are blocked because the wavelength is larger than the mesh openings. Radio waves (meters to kilometers wavelength) pass through easily because they diffract through the small holes. Trade-off: visible light would also pass through, so it would be see-through." |
| **4** | Material + mesh + wavelength reasoning | "Metal mesh with small holes. Cell signals can't get through but radio can because of wavelength differences." |
| **3** | Material + partial reasoning | "Use metal because it blocks signals." |
| **2** | Design without reasoning | "Put up a metal wall." |
| **1** | Unrealistic design | "Use special signal-blocking paint." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Waves & Material Interactions

### Station 1: Transmission-Absorption Lab
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Based on your data, explain why aluminum foil blocks nearly 100% of light while glass transmits most of it.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Data reference + atomic explanation + wave interaction | "Our data showed aluminum transmitted 0% and glass transmitted 85%. Aluminum has free electrons that reflect and absorb the light waves—the electrons oscillate with the wave frequency and re-radiate the energy back. Glass doesn't have free electrons at visible wavelengths, so light passes through. The wave interacts differently based on the material's electron structure." |
| **3** | Data reference + partial explanation | "Aluminum blocks all light (0% transmitted) because metal reflects it. Glass lets most through (85%)." |
| **2** | Data without explanation | "Aluminum: 0%, Glass: 85%. Aluminum is opaque." |
| **1** | Incorrect interpretation | "Glass has holes for light to pass through." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Information Encoding
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** PS4.C | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Explain how a wave can carry the message "HELLO" from one device to another.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Binary conversion + modulation method + transmission | "First, 'HELLO' is converted to binary code (01001000 01000101...). Then the wave is modulated—either amplitude, frequency, or phase shifts to represent 1s and 0s. The transmitter sends the modulated wave, the receiver detects the pattern, and converts it back to letters. The wave carries energy that has been patterned with information." |
| **3** | Binary + modulation concept | "Letters become binary. The wave changes to show 1s and 0s, then gets decoded." |
| **2** | General understanding | "The wave is changed to match the letters somehow." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "The wave carries the actual letters." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Communication System Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS4.C | **CCC:** Systems

**Question:** Design a communication system for a submarine that must communicate with a surface ship.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Wave type + water transmission + backup + limitations | "Use VLF (very low frequency) radio waves because they can penetrate seawater, unlike higher frequencies which are absorbed. The submarine must rise to shallow depth for best reception. Backup: trailing antenna that floats to surface for HF communication. Limitation: VLF is slow data rate and requires very large antennas. For emergencies, acoustic signals work but have shorter range." |
| **4** | Wave type + water consideration + backup | "Low frequency radio works underwater. Have a backup antenna for surface communication." |
| **3** | Wave type + partial reasoning | "Use radio waves that work in water." |
| **2** | Design without wave consideration | "Send radio signals from the submarine." |
| **1** | Impractical design | "Use WiFi underwater." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 3 Rubrics: Synthesis & Assessment

### Synthesis Question
**Question:** A new material transmits 80% of radio waves but only 10% of visible light. Explain this difference and give a real-world application.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Wavelength explanation + atomic mechanism + application | "Radio waves have much longer wavelengths than visible light, so they interact differently with the material's atomic structure. The material might have free electrons that absorb visible light but can't respond fast enough to radio frequencies. Application: window tinting for cars—blocks visible light (privacy) but allows radio (GPS, cell signals) to pass through." |
| **4** | Wavelength + mechanism + application | "Different wavelengths are treated differently by materials. This could be used for windows that block light but allow signals." |
| **3** | Wavelength OR application | "Radio and light have different wavelengths." |
| **2** | General understanding | "Materials affect different waves differently." |
| **1** | Misconception | "The material has holes for radio but not light." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

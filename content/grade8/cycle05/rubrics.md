## Week 1 Rubrics: Wave Properties & Behavior

### Station 1: Wave Tank Investigation
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** PS4.A | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Describe what happens when a wave encounters a gap in a barrier. How does the gap size affect the result?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Identifies diffraction + size relationship + mechanism | "When waves hit a gap, they spread out (diffract) on the other side. Smaller gaps cause more spreading because the wavelength is larger relative to the gap. The wave bends around the edges of the gap, and if the gap is about the same size as the wavelength, the spreading is maximum." |
| **3** | Identifies diffraction + size relationship | "Waves spread out when they go through gaps. Smaller gaps make them spread more." |
| **2** | Identifies behavior without relationship | "Waves go through the gap and spread out." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "The wave stops at the gap." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: EM Spectrum Exploration
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Structure and Function

**Question:** Why can X-rays see through skin but not bone? Use your understanding of wave properties.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Wavelength + density + atomic interaction | "X-rays have very short wavelengths and high energy. They can pass through soft tissue (skin, muscle) because the atoms are spaced apart. But bone has calcium which is denser with more closely packed atoms, so it absorbs the X-rays. The wavelength matters because it determines how the wave interacts with atomic structure." |
| **3** | Wavelength OR density + partial mechanism | "X-rays go through skin because it's less dense. Bone blocks them because it's solid." |
| **2** | General answer | "Bone is harder than skin." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "X-rays can see through everything." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Design a Wave Barrier
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Design a barrier that blocks cell phone signals but allows radio communication.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Material + mesh size + wavelength reasoning + trade-offs | "Use a metal mesh with holes about 5 cm apart. Cell phone signals (microwaves, ~10 cm wavelength) are blocked because the wavelength is larger than the mesh openings. Radio waves (meters to kilometers wavelength) pass through easily because they diffract through the small holes. Trade-off: visible light would also pass through, so it would be see-through." |
| **4** | Material + mesh + wavelength reasoning | "Metal mesh with small holes. Cell signals can't get through but radio can because of wavelength differences." |
| **3** | Material + partial reasoning | "Use metal because it blocks signals." |
| **2** | Design without reasoning | "Put up a metal wall." |
| **1** | Unrealistic design | "Use special signal-blocking paint." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Wave Behavior Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP-6 + DCI PS4.A/PS4.B + CCC Patterns**

**Question:** Sound lets you hear around corners, but light doesn't let you see around corners. Explain this difference using wave properties.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Wavelength + diffraction + mechanism | "Sound waves have much longer wavelengths (meters) compared to light (nanometers). Diffraction—waves bending around obstacles—depends on wavelength relative to obstacle size. Sound diffracts around doorways because its wavelength is similar to doorway width. Light's tiny wavelength means it barely diffracts around corners we encounter. Both are waves, but wavelength determines behavior in real situations." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Wavelength + diffraction mentioned | "Sound has longer wavelengths so it bends around corners more. Light waves are too small to bend around everyday objects." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Partial understanding | "Sound waves can bend but light goes straight." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Major misconceptions | "Sound isn't a wave like light is." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Waves & Material Interactions

### Station 1: Transmission-Absorption Lab
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Based on your data, explain why aluminum foil blocks nearly 100% of light while glass transmits most of it.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Data reference + atomic explanation + wave interaction | "Our data showed aluminum transmitted 0% and glass transmitted 85%. Aluminum has free electrons that reflect and absorb the light waves—the electrons oscillate with the wave frequency and re-radiate the energy back. Glass doesn't have free electrons at visible wavelengths, so light passes through. The wave interacts differently based on the material's electron structure." |
| **3** | Data reference + partial explanation | "Aluminum blocks all light (0% transmitted) because metal reflects it. Glass lets most through (85%)." |
| **2** | Data without explanation | "Aluminum: 0%, Glass: 85%. Aluminum is opaque." |
| **1** | Incorrect interpretation | "Glass has holes for light to pass through." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Information Encoding
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** PS4.C | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Explain how a wave can carry the message "HELLO" from one device to another.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Binary conversion + modulation method + transmission | "First, 'HELLO' is converted to binary code (01001000 01000101...). Then the wave is modulated—either amplitude, frequency, or phase shifts to represent 1s and 0s. The transmitter sends the modulated wave, the receiver detects the pattern, and converts it back to letters. The wave carries energy that has been patterned with information." |
| **3** | Binary + modulation concept | "Letters become binary. The wave changes to show 1s and 0s, then gets decoded." |
| **2** | General understanding | "The wave is changed to match the letters somehow." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "The wave carries the actual letters." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Communication System Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS4.C | **CCC:** Systems

**Question:** Design a communication system for a submarine that must communicate with a surface ship.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Wave type + water transmission + backup + limitations | "Use VLF (very low frequency) radio waves because they can penetrate seawater, unlike higher frequencies which are absorbed. The submarine must rise to shallow depth for best reception. Backup: trailing antenna that floats to surface for HF communication. Limitation: VLF is slow data rate and requires very large antennas. For emergencies, acoustic signals work but have shorter range." |
| **4** | Wave type + water consideration + backup | "Low frequency radio works underwater. Have a backup antenna for surface communication." |
| **3** | Wave type + partial reasoning | "Use radio waves that work in water." |
| **2** | Design without wave consideration | "Send radio signals from the submarine." |
| **1** | Impractical design | "Use WiFi underwater." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Material Interactions Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP-6 + DCI PS4.B/PS4.C + CCC Structure and Function**

**Question:** Your phone's screen is cracked but still works. However, the case has a metal backing that blocks calls. Using wave-material interactions, explain both observations.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Both phenomena + wave-material mechanism | "The cracked screen still displays because visible light from the OLED doesn't need to pass through the crack—light is generated throughout the display surface. But cell signals (radio waves) need to enter and exit the phone. Metal reflects and absorbs radio frequencies because its free electrons oscillate with the wave, re-radiating energy back out. The structure of the material (metal vs. glass) determines which wavelengths can pass." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Both phenomena + partial mechanism | "The screen works because it makes its own light. Metal blocks cell signals because it reflects radio waves." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | One phenomenon explained | "Metal blocks signals because it's solid." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Major misconceptions | "The crack lets signals escape." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 3 Rubrics: Synthesis & Assessment

### Part 1: Synthesis Question
**Question:** A new material transmits 80% of radio waves but only 10% of visible light. Explain this difference and give a real-world application.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Wavelength explanation + atomic mechanism + application | "Radio waves have much longer wavelengths than visible light, so they interact differently with the material's atomic structure. The material might have free electrons that absorb visible light but can't respond fast enough to radio frequencies. Application: window tinting for cars—blocks visible light (privacy) but allows radio (GPS, cell signals) to pass through." |
| **4** | Wavelength + mechanism + application | "Different wavelengths are treated differently by materials. This could be used for windows that block light but allow signals." |
| **3** | Wavelength OR application | "Radio and light have different wavelengths." |
| **2** | General understanding | "Materials affect different waves differently." |
| **1** | Misconception | "The material has holes for radio but not light." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 2A: Wave Properties Assessment
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** PS4.A | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** A student says "All waves behave the same because they're all made of energy." Evaluate this claim and provide evidence to support or refute it.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Refutes + multiple examples + mechanism | "This claim is INCORRECT. While all waves transfer energy, their behavior depends on wavelength. Sound waves (meters) diffract around doorways; light waves (nanometers) create sharp shadows. X-rays penetrate soft tissue; radio waves are blocked by water. Mechanical waves need a medium; EM waves travel through vacuum. Same energy transfer, very different behaviors based on wave properties." |
| **3** | Refutes + examples | "Wrong—sound bends around corners but light doesn't. X-rays go through skin but not bone. Different wavelengths behave differently." |
| **2** | Refutes + limited reasoning | "Not true because different waves do different things." |
| **1** | Accepts claim | "True—energy is energy so waves are the same." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 2B: Material Interactions Assessment
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Structure and Function

**Question:** Explain why a microwave oven has a metal mesh in the door window. Include specific wave-material interactions.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Mesh function + wavelength + safety + seeing through | "Microwaves (~12 cm wavelength) can't pass through the mesh because the holes are much smaller than the wavelength—they see the mesh as a solid barrier and are reflected back. Visible light (~500 nm) passes through easily because the holes are millions of times larger than light's wavelength. The mesh keeps dangerous microwaves inside while letting you see your food. It's a frequency-selective barrier." |
| **3** | Mesh function + wavelength comparison | "The mesh holes are smaller than microwaves but larger than light waves, so light passes through but microwaves don't." |
| **2** | Partial explanation | "The mesh blocks microwaves but lets you see through." |
| **1** | Misconception | "The mesh is for decoration." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 2C: Information Transfer Assessment
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** PS4.C | **CCC:** Systems

**Question:** Design a system to transmit a photo from Mars to Earth. Explain how the image is converted to waves and back.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Complete system + digital conversion + wave modulation + receiver | "The Mars rover camera captures the photo as millions of pixels, each with a color value (digital data). This digital data is converted to binary (1s and 0s). The transmitter encodes this binary by modulating radio waves—each 1 might be a high frequency, each 0 a low frequency. These radio waves travel to Earth at light speed (4-24 min depending on distance). Earth's antenna receives the modulated waves, decodes the binary pattern, and reconstructs the pixel values into the image. Error correction is added because the signal is weak." |
| **4** | System + conversion + modulation | "Camera captures digital image, converts to binary, modulates radio waves, receiver decodes back to image." |
| **3** | Partial system | "Radio waves carry the image data from Mars to Earth where a receiver gets it." |
| **2** | General understanding | "Send the image by radio waves." |
| **1** | Misconception | "Send the actual photo through space." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 2D: Models Assessment (CER Format)
**SEP:** Engaging in Argument from Evidence | **DCI:** PS4.B | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** CLAIM-EVIDENCE-REASONING: Explain why fiber optic cables can transmit more data than copper wires.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Complete CER + technical accuracy | "CLAIM: Fiber optic cables transmit more data than copper wires. EVIDENCE: Fiber uses light (visible/IR) with frequencies ~10¹⁴ Hz. Copper uses electrical signals ~10⁹ Hz. More wave cycles per second = more data encoding opportunities. REASONING: Higher frequency waves can be modulated more rapidly, allowing more 1s and 0s per second. Fiber also has less signal loss over distance because light doesn't resist like electrons in wire. Both factors give fiber 100× higher data capacity." |
| **4** | CER format + mostly accurate | "CLAIM: Fiber carries more data. EVIDENCE: Light frequency is much higher than electrical signals. REASONING: Higher frequency = more data per second because you can encode more quickly." |
| **3** | Partial CER | "Fiber is better because light travels faster and can carry more." |
| **2** | Claim only | "Fiber optic is faster than copper." |
| **1** | Misconception | "They're about the same." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 3: Misconception Check
**Purpose:** Identify and address persistent misconceptions

**Item 1:** TRUE or FALSE and explain: "Waves carry matter from one place to another."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + mechanism + examples | "FALSE. Waves transfer ENERGY, not matter. When a wave passes through water, molecules move up and down but stay in place—a cork on water bobs but doesn't travel with the wave. Sound waves are air molecules vibrating, but the same air molecules stay near your mouth when you speak. Only the energy pattern moves forward." |
| **3** | FALSE + explanation | "FALSE. Waves move energy but particles just vibrate in place." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal explanation | "FALSE. Waves are energy, not matter." |
| **1** | TRUE or confused reasoning | "TRUE. Ocean waves bring water to shore." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Item 2:** TRUE or FALSE and explain: "All electromagnetic waves are equally dangerous."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + energy/frequency relationship + examples | "FALSE. EM wave danger depends on frequency (and thus energy). High-frequency waves (gamma, X-rays, UV) carry enough energy to damage DNA and cause cancer. Lower frequency waves (visible, IR, radio) don't have enough energy per photon to break molecular bonds. A radio tower near you is safer than sunlight because radio waves can't ionize your cells." |
| **3** | FALSE + frequency mention | "FALSE. High-frequency waves like X-rays are dangerous but radio waves are safe." |
| **2** | FALSE + limited reasoning | "FALSE. Some waves are more dangerous than others." |
| **1** | TRUE or confused | "TRUE. All radiation is dangerous." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

**Item 3:** TRUE or FALSE and explain: "Digital signals are waves, analog signals are not."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + both use waves + distinction | "FALSE. Both digital and analog signals are transmitted using waves. The difference is HOW the wave is modified: analog varies the wave continuously (like turning a dimmer), digital uses discrete steps (like flipping a switch on/off). Your voice is analog when you speak (continuous variation), but a phone converts it to digital (samples into 1s and 0s) for transmission, then back to analog at the speaker." |
| **3** | FALSE + basic distinction | "FALSE. Both use waves, but digital encodes in binary while analog varies smoothly." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal | "FALSE. Both are waves." |
| **1** | TRUE or confused | "TRUE. Digital doesn't use waves, it uses electricity." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

**Item 4:** TRUE or FALSE and explain: "Blocking one type of wave (like cell signals) will block all waves."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + wavelength-specific blocking + examples | "FALSE. Materials block different wavelengths differently. A Faraday cage (metal mesh) blocks cell signals but allows light through—the mesh holes are smaller than cell wavelengths but huge compared to visible light. Sunglasses block UV but allow visible light. Lead blocks X-rays but glass doesn't. Blocking is wavelength-dependent based on material structure." |
| **3** | FALSE + example | "FALSE. Metal mesh blocks cell signals but you can still see through it." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal | "FALSE. Different materials block different waves." |
| **1** | TRUE or confused | "TRUE. If one wave can't get through, none can." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

# Grade 8 Cycle 8 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Insulation Engineering & Energy Conservation

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS3-4 (Primary), MS-ETS1-2 (Secondary), MS-PS1-2 & MS-PS2-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Super-Insulator Mystery**
Your friend brings hot coffee in a cheap cup—it's cold within 30 minutes. You bring the same coffee in a vacuum-insulated bottle—it stays hot for 12 hours. How can one container be 24 times better at keeping things hot? What engineering goes into making a thermal "super-insulator"?

**Driving Question:** How can some containers keep drinks cold for 24 hours?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Analyze insulation materials for thermal effectiveness
2. Calculate and predict heat transfer rates
3. Apply engineering design process to thermal challenge
4. Evaluate competing designs using systematic criteria

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "Name the three ways heat transfers and how to block each"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Compare temperature retention in different containers
- **Driving Question:** How do insulated containers keep things hot/cold for hours?
- **Week 1 Connection:** "We learned about heat transfer mechanisms. How do engineers block all three?"
- **Materials:** Regular cup, insulated mug, vacuum bottle, hot water, thermometers
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on Week 1 concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Pour same temperature water in each container
- Measure temperature after 30 minutes
- Show dramatic difference (regular cup = 60°F, vacuum = 180°F)
- "Today we become thermal engineers!"

### Station 1: Insulation Material Analysis (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Test and compare insulation effectiveness
- **Activity:** Measure temperature retention with different insulation types
- **Key Vocabulary:** Insulation, R-value, thermal resistance, heat loss rate
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy conservation from Cycle 7

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Wrap identical containers with different insulation materials
2. Fill with hot water at same starting temperature
3. Measure temperature at 5-minute intervals
4. Graph temperature vs time for each material
5. Calculate rate of temperature loss

**Data Collection:**
| Material | Start Temp | 5 min | 10 min | 15 min | Rate of Loss |
|----------|------------|-------|--------|--------|--------------|
| No insulation | 80°C | ? | ? | ? | °C/min |
| Newspaper | 80°C | ? | ? | ? | °C/min |
| Foam | 80°C | ? | ? | ? | °C/min |
| Foil + foam | 80°C | ? | ? | ? | °C/min |
| Air gap + foil | 80°C | ? | ? | ? | °C/min |

**Analysis Questions:**
1. Which combination was most effective? Why?
2. How does a vacuum bottle work better than any of these?
3. Which mechanism contributes most to heat loss in a regular cup?

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Engineering design process for thermal systems
- **Model:** How to systematically design, test, and improve
- **Think-Aloud:** "If my first design loses too much heat, what should I change and why?"
- **Visual:** Engineering design cycle diagram

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Define problem and constraints clearly
2. Brainstorm multiple solutions
3. Build and test prototype
4. Analyze data to identify weaknesses
5. Iterate: improve and retest
6. Evaluate against criteria

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What makes an insulation material effective?"
- Review insulation test results
- Preview design challenge

### Station 2: Energy Conservation Calculations (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Quantify heat transfer and energy loss
- **Activity:** Calculate energy lost based on temperature change
- **Spiral Connection:** Conservation of mass/energy from Cycle 7

**Calculation Practice:**
Energy = mass × specific heat × temperature change
Q = m × c × ΔT

| Variable | Symbol | Unit | Example |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Energy | Q | Joules (J) | Amount of heat transferred |
| Mass | m | grams (g) | Amount of water |
| Specific heat | c | J/g°C | 4.18 for water |
| Temperature change | ΔT | °C | Start - End |

**Practice Problems:**
1. 500g of water cools from 80°C to 40°C. How much energy was lost?
2. If a container loses 84,000 J of heat energy, and the water started at 90°C, what is the final temperature? (500g water)
3. Compare: Which lost more energy—100g water cooling 50°C or 300g water cooling 20°C?

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Where does the "lost" energy go?
2. Why does more mass take longer to cool?
3. How can we reduce energy loss without using more material?

### Station 3: Design an Insulated Container (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply thermal engineering to design challenge (MS-ETS1-2)
- **Activity:** Design, build, and test an insulated container
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-3 (Planning Investigations) + SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations)

**Design Challenge:**
Design an insulated container that keeps ice frozen for the longest possible time. You will compete against other designs in the Engineering Showcase next week.

**Design Constraints:**
1. Maximum material cost: $5 (assigned values per material)
2. Must fit in a 20cm × 20cm × 20cm space
3. Must be able to open and close to check ice
4. No active cooling (no ice packs, electricity)

**Material Costs:**
| Material | Cost per unit | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Cardboard (1 sheet) | $0.50 | Good insulator, absorbs moisture |
| Aluminum foil (30cm) | $0.25 | Reflects radiation |
| Foam sheet (1 piece) | $1.00 | Good insulator |
| Cotton batting (cup) | $0.50 | Traps air |
| Plastic wrap (30cm) | $0.25 | Moisture barrier |
| Air gap design | Free | Reduces conduction |

**Design Plan Must Include:**
1. Sketch with labeled materials
2. Cost calculation (must be ≤$5)
3. How each mechanism is addressed
4. Predicted performance with reasoning

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Encourage layered approaches
- Discuss trade-offs between cost and performance
- Connect to real insulation engineering (houses, refrigerators)
- Designs will be tested and presented in Week 3

  - 2 NEW questions (insulation, energy calculations)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Week 1: mechanisms; Cycle 7: energy conservation)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect all mechanisms to design)

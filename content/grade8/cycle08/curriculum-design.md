## Overview

This culminating cycle explores thermal energy transfer and concludes with Year-End Integration activities. Students investigate how heat moves through conduction, convection, and radiation, then apply this understanding to design insulation challenges. Week 3 combines cycle assessment with an Engineering Showcase (integrating MS-ETS1-2) and year-end reflection, synthesizing the full G8 science experience.

## Standards Alignment

### Primary Standard
- **MS-PS3-4:** Plan an investigation to determine the relationships among the energy transferred, the type of matter, the mass, and the change in the average kinetic energy of the particles as measured by the temperature of the sample.

### Integrated Engineering Standard (from deferred Cycle 10)
- **MS-ETS1-2:** Evaluate competing design solutions using a systematic process to determine how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.

### Spiral Standards
| Code | Description | From Cycle | Integration Point |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| MS-PS1-2 | Chemical reactions | Cycle 7 | Exothermic/endothermic energy |
| MS-PS2-3 | Electric and magnetic forces | Cycle 6 | Energy transformation |

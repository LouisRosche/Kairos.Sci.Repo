## Week 1 Rubrics: Thermal Conductivity & Heat Transfer

### Station 1: Conductivity Race
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** PS3.A | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Explain why metals are good thermal conductors while wood is a good insulator. Include particle-level explanation.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Both materials + particle explanation + free electrons | "Metals have free electrons that move easily through the material. When one end is heated, electrons gain energy and rapidly carry it to the other end. Wood doesn't have free electrons—its particles are locked in place, and it has air pockets that slow heat transfer. Metals conduct 100-1000× faster than wood because of this electron mobility." |
| **3** | Both materials + partial particle explanation | "Metals have free electrons that carry heat quickly. Wood doesn't, so it's slower." |
| **2** | General comparison | "Metals heat up faster than wood." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Metals are cold so they absorb heat." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Three Mechanisms Lab
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS3.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** Describe how heat transfers from the sun to Earth. Why is this different from how heat transfers through a metal rod?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Radiation + conduction contrast + vacuum explanation | "The sun heats Earth through RADIATION—electromagnetic waves that travel through the vacuum of space. No particles needed! A metal rod uses CONDUCTION—particles vibrate and pass energy to neighboring particles by direct contact. Radiation can cross empty space; conduction requires matter. The sun's light and infrared waves travel 150 million km through vacuum, then warm Earth's surface when absorbed." |
| **3** | Radiation + conduction contrast | "Sun uses radiation which doesn't need matter. Rod uses conduction which needs particles touching." |
| **2** | Identifies one mechanism correctly | "The sun uses radiation." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Heat travels through the air from the sun." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Thermal Shield Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS3.B | **CCC:** Structure and Function

**Question:** Design a thermal shield to protect ice from a heat lamp. Explain how your design addresses all three heat transfer mechanisms.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | All three mechanisms + specific materials + reasoning | "My design has three layers: 1) RADIATION: Outer layer of aluminum foil reflects infrared radiation back toward the lamp. 2) CONDUCTION: Middle layer of foam creates high resistance to heat flow through the material—its structure traps air which doesn't conduct well. 3) CONVECTION: Inner air gap prevents warm air currents from directly reaching the ice. The layers work together—foil alone would conduct, foam alone wouldn't reflect." |
| **4** | All three mechanisms + materials | "Foil for radiation, foam for conduction, air gap for convection." |
| **3** | Two mechanisms addressed | "Foil reflects heat and foam insulates." |
| **2** | One mechanism | "Use insulation to block heat." |
| **1** | No mechanism understanding | "Make it thick." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Insulation Engineering

### Station 1: Insulation Material Analysis
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** PS3.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Based on your data, rank three insulation materials by effectiveness. Explain the pattern you observe.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct ranking + pattern + explanation | "Ranking (best to worst): 1) Foam + foil (0.5°C/min loss), 2) Foam alone (0.8°C/min), 3) Newspaper (1.2°C/min). Pattern: combinations work better than single materials because they address multiple mechanisms. Foam blocks conduction; foil blocks radiation. Together they lose less heat than either alone. All are better than uninsulated (2.0°C/min)." |
| **3** | Correct ranking + pattern | "Foam + foil was best because it blocks two types of heat transfer." |
| **2** | Correct ranking only | "Foam + foil, foam, newspaper." |
| **1** | Incorrect ranking | "Newspaper was best." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Energy Conservation Calculations
**SEP:** Using Mathematics | **DCI:** PS3.B | **CCC:** Scale, Proportion, Quantity

**Question:** 200g of water cools from 90°C to 60°C. Calculate the energy lost. (Specific heat of water = 4.18 J/g°C)

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct calculation + units + interpretation | "Q = m × c × ΔT = 200g × 4.18 J/g°C × 30°C = 25,080 J (or 25.08 kJ). This is the thermal energy that flowed from the hot water to the surroundings. The water lost this energy, but it wasn't destroyed—it warmed up the environment instead." |
| **3** | Correct calculation + units | "Q = 200 × 4.18 × 30 = 25,080 Joules" |
| **2** | Correct setup, minor error | "Q = 200 × 4.18 × 30 = [calculation error]" |
| **1** | Wrong formula or major error | "Q = 90 - 60 = 30" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Container Design (MS-ETS1-2)
**SEP:** Developing Possible Solutions | **DCI:** ETS1.B | **CCC:** Systems

**Question:** Evaluate your insulated container design. What worked well? What would you improve?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Strengths + weaknesses + specific improvement + evidence | "Strengths: My foil layer successfully reflected radiation (ice side facing lamp melted 20% slower). Foam core reduced conduction effectively. Weakness: My design had gaps at the corners where warm air could enter (convection). Data showed 15% more melting near corners. Improvement: Use tape or caulk to seal all gaps, or redesign with overlapping foam pieces. Cost: $4.50, so I have $0.50 for sealing materials." |
| **4** | Strengths + weaknesses + improvement | "Foil worked for radiation but gaps let warm air in. Would seal better next time." |
| **3** | Strengths OR weaknesses | "My design kept 60% of ice for 2 hours." |
| **2** | Vague evaluation | "It worked okay." |
| **1** | No engineering thinking | "It didn't work." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

| "Only conduction" | Three mechanisms: conduction, convection, radiation | "How does the sun heat Earth?" |

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Place identical ice cube in each container
2. Record starting ice mass
3. Leave containers in same environment
4. Check at 30-minute intervals
5. Measure remaining ice mass after 2 hours

**Data Recording:**
| Design Feature | Measurement | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------|
| Total cost | $____ | Must be ≤$5 |
| Materials used | List | |
| Ice mass (start) | ____g | |
| Ice mass (30 min) | ____g | |
| Ice mass (60 min) | ____g | |
| Ice mass (120 min) | ____g | |
| Performance score | ____% remaining | |

### Presentation Preparation (35 min | 10 pts)
- **Focus:** Create presentation explaining design decisions

**Presentation Requirements:**
1. Problem statement and constraints (30 sec)
2. Design explanation with diagram (1 min)
3. How each heat transfer mechanism is addressed (1 min)
4. Test results with data (1 min)
5. What you would improve (30 sec)
6. Total: 4 minutes per presentation

**Preparation Checklist:**
- [ ] Visual diagram of design (digital or poster)
- [ ] Data table with test results
- [ ] Explanation of thermal engineering principles
- [ ] Honest assessment of strengths and weaknesses
- [ ] Practice timing

---

## Day 2: Engineering Showcase Presentations (40 pts)

### Engineering Showcase Structure

**Presentation Format:**
- 4 minutes per student
- 1-2 questions from peers
- Teacher and peer evaluation using rubric

**Evaluation Criteria (MS-ETS1-2):**

| Criteria | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Problem Definition | 5 | Clear statement of constraints |
| Design Explanation | 10 | Logical connection to thermal principles |
| Evidence Presentation | 10 | Data supports claims |
| Mechanism Coverage | 10 | Addresses all three mechanisms |
| Reflection/Improvement | 5 | Honest assessment and iteration ideas |
| **Total** | **40** | |

**Peer Evaluation:**
- Each student evaluates 3 peer presentations
- Focus on: Strengths, Questions, Suggestions
- Collected for feedback

### Presentation Schedule
- Groups of 4-5 students per rotation
- 25-30 minutes per rotation
- Transition time between groups

### Class Discussion (15 min)
- What design features worked best?
- What common mistakes did we see?
- How does this connect to real engineering?

## Day 3: Cycle 8 Assessment + Year Reflection (40 pts)

### Cycle 8 Content Assessment (25 pts | 35 min)

**Section A: Thermal Conductivity (8 pts)**
- Compare conductors and insulators
- Explain in terms of particle motion
- Predict heat transfer based on materials

**Section B: Heat Transfer Mechanisms (8 pts)**
- Identify and explain conduction, convection, radiation
- Apply to real-world scenarios
- Connect to particle-level explanations

**Section C: Engineering Application (9 pts)**
- Analyze design decisions
- Evaluate trade-offs
- Connect thermal principles to design choices

### Year-End Reflection (15 pts | 20 min)

**CCC Synthesis (10 pts):**
Apply assigned CCC to thermal energy systems. Connect to at least one other cycle.

| CCC | Thermal Application Example |
|-----|----------------------------|
| Patterns | Temperature decay patterns; cooling curves |
| Cause & Effect | Material properties cause conductivity differences |
| Scale | Particle motion → macroscopic temperature |
| Systems | Thermal equilibrium in closed systems |
| Energy & Matter | Energy flows from hot to cold; conserved |
| Structure & Function | Molecular structure determines conductivity |
| Stability & Change | Systems move toward thermal equilibrium |

**Year Reflection (5 pts):**
Students complete reflection on their scientific growth:

**Reflection Prompts:**
1. What was the most surprising thing you learned this year?
2. Which Science & Engineering Practice (SEP) did you improve the most? Provide evidence.
3. How has your understanding of energy changed from Cycle 4 to now?
4. What scientific questions do you still want to explore?

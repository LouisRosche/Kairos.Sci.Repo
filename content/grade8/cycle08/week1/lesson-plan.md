# Grade 8 Cycle 8 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Thermal Conductivity & Heat Transfer

**NGSS Standards:** MS-PS3-4 (Primary), MS-PS1-2 & MS-PS2-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Hot Spoon Mystery**
You're stirring hot soup with a metal spoon, and within seconds, the handle becomes too hot to hold. But a wooden spoon in the same soup stays perfectly cool. Both are in the same hot liquid—why does one conduct heat while the other doesn't? And why does the metal spoon eventually reach the same temperature as the soup?

**Driving Question:** Why does a metal spoon get hot in soup but a wooden spoon doesn't?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain thermal conductivity in terms of particle motion
2. Distinguish between conduction, convection, and radiation
3. Predict heat transfer based on material properties
4. Design investigations to test thermal properties

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What is energy? How can it be transferred?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Metal vs wooden spoon in hot water demonstration
- **Driving Question:** Why does the metal spoon get hot but the wooden spoon doesn't?
- **Prior Knowledge Connection:** "We studied energy transformation. Where does the spoon's heat energy come from?"
- **Materials:** Metal spoons, wooden spoons, hot water, thermometer
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on energy concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Place both spoons in same hot water
- Students touch handles after 30 seconds
- Metal = hot, wood = cool
- Key question: "What's different about these materials?"
- "Today we discover how heat moves through different materials"

### Station 1: Conductivity Race (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Compare thermal conductivity of different materials
- **Activity:** Time how long until heat reaches end of different rods
- **Key Vocabulary:** Thermal conductivity, conductor, insulator, equilibrium
- **Spiral Connection:** Chemical reaction energy from Cycle 7

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Set up identical lengths of different materials (metal, wood, plastic, glass)
2. Apply heat to one end simultaneously
3. Measure time until wax bead falls off other end (or use thermometers)
4. Rank materials by conductivity
5. Explain results in terms of particle motion

**Material Comparison:**
| Material | Relative Conductivity | Observation | Explanation |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Copper | Very high | Heats fastest | Free electrons transfer energy rapidly |
| Steel | High | Heats quickly | Metal lattice transfers vibrations |
| Glass | Low | Heats slowly | Amorphous structure resists transfer |
| Wood | Very low | Barely heats | Porous, air pockets insulate |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Metal is cold" | Metal conducts heat away from hand quickly | Metal at room temp feels cold because it pulls heat from you |
| "Cold flows into things" | Heat flows out; cold is absence of heat | Never say "cold flows"—always "heat flows out" |
| "Things 'hold' heat" | Heat is energy in motion, not stored | Compare ice in insulated vs non-insulated container |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Three mechanisms of heat transfer
- **Model:** How conduction, convection, and radiation differ
- **Think-Aloud:** "How does the sun warm Earth if there's no air in space?"
- **Visual:** Particle motion animations for each mechanism

**Key Points to Model:**
1. **Conduction:** Direct particle contact; solids primarily
2. **Convection:** Fluid circulation; liquids and gases
3. **Radiation:** Electromagnetic waves; no medium needed
4. Heat ALWAYS flows from hot to cold

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete conductivity measurements
- **Extension:** Research thermal conductivity in engineering applications
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on energy concepts

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Name the three mechanisms of heat transfer"
- Review conductivity results
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Three Mechanisms Lab (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Observe and compare all three heat transfer mechanisms
- **Activity:** Design mini-experiments to demonstrate each mechanism
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy transformation from Cycle 6

**Mechanism Demonstrations:**
| Mechanism | Demonstration | Evidence |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Conduction | Heat metal rod, feel temperature along length | Sequential heating, requires contact |
| Convection | Add dye to heated water, observe circulation | Circular motion, warm rises, cool sinks |
| Radiation | Feel warmth from heat lamp across empty space | Warmth without contact or air movement |

**Investigation Questions:**
1. Which mechanism is fastest? Which is slowest?
2. Can radiation occur through a vacuum? How do you know?
3. Which mechanism heats your home? How about the sun warming Earth?

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why does hot air rise? Connect to particle motion.
2. How does a thermos bottle minimize ALL three mechanisms?
3. Which mechanism is most important for cooking? For climate?

### Station 3: Design a Thermal Shield (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply heat transfer understanding to engineering problem
- **Activity:** Design a shield to protect ice from a heat source
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-3 (Planning Investigations) + SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations)

**Design Challenge:**
Design a thermal shield to protect an ice cube from a 100-watt heat lamp. The ice must survive at least 30 minutes.

**Design Requirements:**
1. Must address all three heat transfer mechanisms
2. Limited to provided materials (foil, foam, cardboard, fabric)
3. Size constraint: must fit in 15cm cube
4. Cannot touch the ice directly

**Design Plan Must Include:**
1. How each mechanism is blocked or minimized
2. Material selection with justification
3. Predicted effectiveness for each mechanism
4. Trade-offs in your design

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Foil reflects radiation but conducts heat
- Foam insulates but doesn't reflect
- Air gaps reduce conduction
- Layering combines benefits

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (conductivity, mechanisms)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 7: energy in reactions; Cycle 6: energy transfer)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect particle motion to conductivity)
  - 1 SEP-6 question (Explain heat transfer mechanism)

## Hook: The Melting Ice Mystery (12 pts)

### Hook Q2: Prediction - Ice Exposes Ocean (3 pts)
**Question:** When ice melts, it exposes dark ocean water underneath. How might this affect the temperature of the area?

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Connects color to absorption/reflection with temperature consequence
- 2 pts: Mentions color difference with partial explanation
- 1 pt: Vague response
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> When ice melts and exposes dark ocean water, the area will get warmer. This is because ice is white and reflects most of the sunlight back into space (high albedo). But dark ocean water absorbs most of the sunlight energy (low albedo). When light energy is absorbed, it converts to heat. So the more ice that melts, the more dark ocean is exposed, and the more heat is absorbed - making the area even warmer.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Dark water absorbs more light and gets hotter than white ice. So when ice melts, more heat is absorbed.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> It gets warmer because the ocean is warmer than ice.

---

### Hook Q4: Week 1 Connection (3 pts)
**Question:** How does the greenhouse effect (CO₂ trapping heat) connect to this ice-melting feedback loop?

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Correctly connects to CO₂/greenhouse effect from Week 1 as initiating cause
- 2 pts: Mentions Week 1 concepts but unclear connection
- 1 pt: Vague connection
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> The greenhouse effect starts the feedback loop. CO₂ in the atmosphere absorbs infrared radiation (like we learned in Week 1), which warms the Earth. This warming causes ice to melt. When ice melts, it exposes dark ocean water, which has lower albedo and absorbs more heat. This makes the Earth even warmer, which melts more ice. So the greenhouse effect is the initial cause, and the ice-albedo feedback amplifies it.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> CO₂ traps heat which makes ice melt. Then when ice melts, more heat gets absorbed.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> They both involve heat.

---

## Station 1: Albedo Effect Investigation (20 pts)

### Station 1 Q1: Data Recording (5 pts)
**Question:** Record your temperature data for each surface after 3 minutes under the heat lamp.
Format: Surface | Start Temp | End Temp | Change

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: All 4 surfaces with clear starting temp, ending temp, and change
- 4 pts: All 4 surfaces but missing one measurement
- 3 pts: 3 surfaces complete
- 2 pts: 2 surfaces complete
- 1 pt: Incomplete data
- 0 pts: No data

### Exemplar (5/5)
> Black paper | 22°C | 35°C | +13°C
> White paper | 22°C | 27°C | +5°C
> Aluminum foil | 22°C | 24°C | +2°C
> Water | 22°C | 30°C | +8°C
>
> Pattern: Darker surfaces heated more. Reflective surfaces (foil) heated least.

### Acceptable (4/5)
> Black paper: 22 to 34, changed 12 degrees
> White paper: 22 to 26, changed 4 degrees
> Foil: 22 to 23, changed 1 degree
> Water: didn't record end temp

### Insufficient (2/5)
> Black got hot
> White stayed cool

---

### Station 1 Q3: Explain Albedo Pattern (5 pts)
**Question:** Using the concept of ALBEDO, explain WHY some surfaces heated more than others.

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Explains that dark surfaces absorb more light energy → more heating + light surfaces reflect → less heating, using albedo term correctly
- 4 pts: Correct explanation but missing one element
- 3 pts: Partially correct
- 2 pts: Vague explanation
- 1 pt: Incorrect
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> Black paper heated the most because dark colors have LOW albedo - they absorb most of the light energy instead of reflecting it. When light energy is absorbed, it converts to thermal energy, making the molecules vibrate faster (like we learned in Week 1). This is why the temperature increased so much.
>
> Aluminum foil heated the least because it has HIGH albedo - it reflects most of the light back. The energy never enters the material, so the molecules don't speed up.
>
> White paper is in between because it reflects more than black but less than foil.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> Dark colors absorb more light and get hotter. Light colors reflect light and stay cooler. Albedo measures how much light reflects.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> Black gets hot and white stays cool because black is a hotter color.

**RED FLAG:** "Black is a hotter color" - color misconception; color affects ABSORPTION, it doesn't carry inherent temperature.

---

### Station 1 Q5: Ice-Albedo Feedback Application (3 pts)
**Question:** Complete the chain: Ice (high albedo) → Ice melts → Ocean exposed (low albedo) → ??? Explain how this creates a feedback loop.

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Correctly traces full feedback loop with albedo change, labels as positive feedback
- 2 pts: Partial feedback loop
- 1 pt: Missing feedback concept
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Ice (high albedo) → Ice melts → Dark ocean exposed (low albedo) → Ocean absorbs more sunlight → Water temperature rises → More ice melts → Even more dark ocean exposed → [cycle continues]
>
> This is a POSITIVE feedback loop because the change (warming/melting) amplifies itself. Each cycle makes the next one stronger.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Ocean absorbs more light → gets warmer → more ice melts. It's positive feedback.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> The ocean gets warmer.

---

## Station 2: Carbon Sink Analysis (20 pts)

### Station 2 Q1: Carbon Budget Calculation (4 pts)
**Question:** Using the data: How many gigatons of CO₂ remain in atmosphere each year? Explain what this means for atmospheric CO₂ over time.

**Reference Data:**
- Sources: 41 Gt/year (fossil fuels + deforestation)
- Sinks: 22 Gt/year (ocean + land absorption)

**Rubric:**
- 4 pts: Correct calculation (19 Gt) with work shown AND interpretation
- 3 pts: Correct answer with work
- 2 pts: Correct setup but calculation error
- 1 pt: Attempted but incorrect
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> Calculation: 41 Gt emitted - 22 Gt absorbed = 19 Gt remaining in atmosphere per year
>
> Interpretation: This means atmospheric CO₂ is INCREASING every year because we emit more than Earth can absorb. At 19 Gt/year, CO₂ levels will keep rising even with carbon sinks, which will intensify the greenhouse effect and warming. The sinks can't keep up with emissions.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> 41 - 22 = 19 gigatons stay in the atmosphere each year. This means CO₂ goes up over time.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> There's more CO₂ than the Earth can handle.

---

### Station 2 Q4: Identify the Feedback (4 pts)
**Question:** Complete: More CO₂ → Warmer climate → Ocean absorbs LESS CO₂ → ??? Is this positive or negative feedback? Explain.

**Rubric:**
- 4 pts: Correctly identifies positive feedback with complete chain
- 3 pts: Identifies positive feedback with partial chain
- 2 pts: Identifies feedback but wrong type
- 1 pt: No feedback concept
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> More CO₂ → Warmer climate → Ocean absorbs LESS CO₂ → MORE CO₂ stays in atmosphere → Even warmer climate → [cycle continues]
>
> This is POSITIVE feedback (amplifying, not "good"). The original change (more CO₂) causes effects that lead to even MORE of that change. Positive feedback means the system pushes itself further in the same direction.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> More CO₂ stays in air → warmer → absorbs even less. It's positive feedback because it makes itself worse.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> This is negative feedback because CO₂ is bad.

**RED FLAG:** "Negative because CO₂ is bad" - confusing "positive/negative" with "good/bad." Positive = amplifying, negative = stabilizing.

---

### Station 2 Q5: System Prediction (4 pts)
**Question:** Will climate change happen at a CONSTANT rate, or will it ACCELERATE over time? Explain using at least ONE feedback loop.

**Rubric:**
- 4 pts: Predicts acceleration with correct reasoning from feedback
- 3 pts: Correct prediction with partial reasoning
- 2 pts: Prediction without feedback reasoning
- 1 pt: Incorrect prediction
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> Climate change will ACCELERATE over time because of positive feedback loops. For example, the ice-albedo feedback: As ice melts, more dark ocean is exposed, which absorbs more heat, which melts more ice even faster. Each cycle is stronger than the last.
>
> The carbon sink feedback also accelerates warming: warmer oceans absorb less CO₂, so more CO₂ stays in the atmosphere, which causes more warming, which reduces absorption even further.
>
> These loops compound - they don't just add, they multiply. This is why scientists are concerned about "tipping points" - once certain thresholds are crossed, the acceleration becomes unstoppable.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> Climate change will accelerate because feedback loops amplify the change. Ice melting exposes dark water which absorbs more heat, which melts more ice.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> It will probably stay the same because we've been emitting CO₂ for a long time and it's been gradual.

## Station 3: Engineering Carbon Capture (25 pts)

### Station 3 Q1: Design Description (5 pts)
**Question:** Describe your carbon capture system: What approach(es)? Where located? What materials needed?

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Specific design with clear components and location
- 4 pts: Clear design with minor gaps
- 3 pts: General design concept
- 2 pts: Vague description
- 1 pt: Minimal attempt
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> **Approach:** Tree planting combined with a school garden composting system
>
> **Location:**
> - Trees along the front entrance (20 trees in existing grass areas)
> - Compost bins behind the cafeteria near the existing garden
>
> **Materials needed:**
> - 20 native tree saplings (~$15 each = $300)
> - 3 compost bins ($50 each = $150)
> - Mulch and soil amendments ($50)
> - Total: $500 (within budget)
>
> The trees will absorb CO₂ through photosynthesis, and the compost will keep organic carbon in the soil instead of releasing it as methane in a landfill.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> Plant trees around the school. Put them in the grassy areas. Need to buy tree saplings and shovels.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> Use trees.

---

### Station 3 Q2: Carbon Calculation (5 pts)
**Question:** Estimate how much CO₂ your system would capture per year. Reference: 1 tree ≈ 48 lbs CO₂/year. SHOW YOUR WORK!

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Correct calculation with clear work and units
- 4 pts: Correct answer with partial work shown
- 3 pts: Setup correct but calculation error
- 2 pts: Attempted calculation
- 1 pt: No calculation attempted
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> **Tree absorption:**
> 20 trees × 48 lbs CO₂/year = 960 lbs CO₂/year
>
> **Compost (estimated):**
> Composting food waste instead of landfill prevents ~300 lbs methane/year
> (Methane is 80x stronger than CO₂, so this is significant)
>
> **Total impact:** ~960 lbs CO₂ absorbed + methane prevention
>
> **Context:** One American produces ~36,000 lbs CO₂/year. So our system offsets about 960/36,000 = 2.7% of one person's emissions. It's a start, but we'd need ~37 systems like this to offset one person completely!

### Acceptable (4/5)
> 20 trees × 48 lbs = 960 lbs of CO₂ per year. That's not even 1% of what one person produces.

### Insufficient (2/5)
> Lots of CO₂.

---

### Station 3 Q3: Scientific Justification (8 pts)
**Question:** Explain HOW your system captures CO₂, WHERE the carbon goes, and HOW LONG it stays stored.

**Rubric:**
- 8 pts: Explains HOW at molecular level + WHERE carbon goes + HOW LONG stored
- 6 pts: Explains 2 of 3 elements well
- 4 pts: Explains 1 element well
- 2 pts: General explanation without molecular detail
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (8/8)
> **HOW:** My system uses trees to capture CO₂. Trees do photosynthesis: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. The carbon atoms from CO₂ get rearranged into glucose molecules. Then glucose gets converted into cellulose, which is what wood is made of.
>
> **WHERE:** The carbon goes into the tree's trunk, branches, roots, and leaves as cellulose (wood) and other organic molecules. Some carbon also ends up in the soil when leaves decompose. The carbon atoms from atmospheric CO₂ become carbon atoms in solid wood.
>
> **HOW LONG:** Trees store carbon for decades to centuries - as long as the tree is alive. A 100-year-old oak has been storing carbon for 100 years. BUT if the tree burns or decomposes, the carbon returns to the atmosphere as CO₂. So the storage isn't permanent unless we protect the forest from fire and cutting.

### Acceptable (5/8)
> Trees absorb CO₂ through photosynthesis and store it in their wood. The carbon stays there until the tree dies or burns. It could last 50+ years.

### Insufficient (2/8)
> Trees are good for the environment and absorb carbon. It helps with climate change.

**RED FLAG:** "Trees are good for the environment" - too vague, no mechanism. Push for HOW/WHERE/HOW LONG.

---

### Station 3 Q4: Acknowledge Limitations (4 pts)
**Question:** What are the LIMITATIONS of your design? Consider space, maintenance, saturation, risks.

**Rubric:**
- 4 pts: Identifies 2+ real limitations with thoughtful analysis
- 3 pts: Identifies 2+ limitations
- 2 pts: Identifies 1 limitation
- 1 pt: Vague limitation
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> **Limitations:**
>
> 1. **Space:** We can only fit ~20 trees without removing parking or buildings. That's only 960 lbs CO₂/year - not even 3% of one person's emissions.
>
> 2. **Time:** Trees take years to reach full carbon absorption capacity. Saplings absorb less than mature trees.
>
> 3. **Permanence risk:** If trees die, get cut down, or burn in a fire, all the stored carbon returns to the atmosphere as CO₂. We'd need ongoing protection.
>
> 4. **Maintenance:** Trees need watering, pruning, and disease management. Who will do this during summer break?
>
> Our system is a good start but won't solve climate change alone - it needs to be part of a larger effort.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> We don't have much space for trees, and if they die or burn the carbon goes back into the air. Also someone needs to water them.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> There are some problems.

---

### Station 3 Q5: Feedback Connection (3 pts)
**Question:** How does your carbon capture system relate to the feedback loops we studied? Could it break a positive feedback or create a negative feedback?

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Correctly identifies how design relates to feedback loops
- 2 pts: Partial connection
- 1 pt: No feedback concept
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> My carbon capture system could help create a NEGATIVE (stabilizing) feedback loop:
>
> More CO₂ → Trees absorb more → Less CO₂ in atmosphere → Less warming
>
> This is negative feedback because the change (more CO₂) triggers a response (tree absorption) that REDUCES the original change.
>
> However, it can only SLOW DOWN the positive feedback loops, not stop them. If emissions continue faster than trees can absorb, the positive feedback (warming → ice melt → more warming) still dominates. My system is like a brake, not a full stop.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Trees absorb CO₂, which would reduce warming. This is the opposite of the positive feedback we studied.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> It helps with climate change.

---

## Exit Ticket: Feedback Loop Integration (23 pts)

### Exit Q1: Define Albedo (4 pts)
**Question:** Define ALBEDO and explain how it affects Earth's temperature. Use ice and ocean as examples.

**Rubric:**
- 4 pts: Defines albedo correctly + gives ice/ocean example with temperature consequence
- 3 pts: Correct definition with example
- 2 pts: Partial definition
- 1 pt: Vague response
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> **Albedo** is the fraction of light that a surface reflects. It ranges from 0 (absorbs all light) to 1 (reflects all light).
>
> **Ice** has HIGH albedo (~0.8) - it reflects about 80% of sunlight back into space. This keeps ice-covered areas cool.
>
> **Ocean** has LOW albedo (~0.06) - it absorbs about 94% of sunlight. This makes ocean water warm.
>
> **Temperature effect:** Because ice reflects light and ocean absorbs it, the more ice that melts (exposing ocean), the more heat Earth absorbs, which causes more warming. This is the ice-albedo feedback that accelerates climate change.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> Albedo is how much light reflects. Ice has high albedo and reflects light, so it stays cool. Ocean has low albedo and absorbs light, so it gets warmer.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> Albedo is about light and temperature.

---

### Exit Q5: Integration (4 pts)
**Question:** Explain how greenhouse effect, ice-albedo feedback, and carbon sink feedback connect and amplify each other.

**Rubric (3D Assessment):**
- 4 pts: Connects greenhouse effect + ice-albedo feedback + carbon cycle correctly
- 3 pts: Connects 2 of 3 concepts
- 2 pts: Connects 1 concept to the scenario
- 1 pt: No real integration
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> These three processes create interconnected positive feedback loops:
>
> 1. **Greenhouse effect** (Week 1): CO₂ absorbs infrared radiation, making molecules vibrate and trapping heat. This warms the Earth.
>
> 2. **Ice-albedo feedback** (Week 2): Warming melts ice, exposing dark ocean (low albedo), which absorbs more heat, causing more warming and more melting.
>
> 3. **Carbon sink feedback** (Week 2): Warming makes oceans absorb less CO₂ (warm water holds less gas), so more CO₂ stays in the atmosphere, causing more greenhouse effect.
>
> They amplify each other: Greenhouse effect → warming → ice melts AND oceans absorb less → more CO₂ in air → stronger greenhouse effect → more warming. It's a system of positive feedbacks pushing in the same direction.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> All three cause warming that makes itself worse. CO₂ traps heat, melting ice absorbs more heat, and warm oceans absorb less CO₂.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> They all involve heat and climate change.

---

### Exit Q6: Feedback Loop Model (3 pts)
**Question:** Create a feedback loop model in text format for ice-albedo feedback.

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Complete loop with arrows showing direction AND labels explaining each step
- 2 pts: Loop with arrows OR labels (not both)
- 1 pt: Incomplete loop
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
```
Temperature rises → Ice melts → Dark ocean exposed → More sunlight absorbed → Temperature rises more
       ↑                                                                              ↓
       ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← (Loop continues - more melting, more absorption) ←←←←←←←←←←←←
```
> This is positive feedback because the OUTPUT (rising temperature) feeds back to AMPLIFY the original change. Each cycle makes the next cycle stronger. "Positive" means amplifying, not good.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Temp up → ice melts → ocean exposed → absorbs more → temp up → more melting
>
> (Shows the loop but missing the return arrow or "amplifying" explanation)

### Insufficient (1/3)
> Ice melts because it's hot. Then more ice melts.

## Hook: The Whale Finger Mystery (12 pts)

### Hook Q2: Initial Hypothesis (3 pts)
**Question:** Why might a whale have finger bones inside its flipper? Propose a hypothesis.

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Proposes common ancestor or evolutionary origin
- 2 pts: Reasonable hypothesis with some logic
- 1 pt: Vague guess
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Whales probably evolved from land mammals that had arms with fingers. Over millions of years, as whale ancestors moved into the ocean, natural selection favored individuals with limbs better suited for swimming. The arms gradually became flippers. But the basic bone pattern (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, digits) was passed down from the land-dwelling ancestor - it just got reshaped for a different function. The finger bones are "left over" from when whale ancestors walked on land.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Whales evolved from animals that had fingers. The bones stayed but changed shape for swimming.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> Maybe whales used to walk.

---

### Hook Q4: Week 1 Connection (3 pts)
**Question:** How does natural selection explain why whale flippers look different from human hands, even though they have the same bones?

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Connects to natural selection AND population-level change
- 2 pts: Mentions Week 1 concepts but unclear connection
- 1 pt: Vague response
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Natural selection shaped the same bones differently because of different environments:
>
> **Whales:** Ancestors that were born with limbs more suited for swimming (flatter, more paddle-like) caught more fish and escaped predators better. They survived and reproduced more. Over millions of generations, the whale POPULATION developed flippers.
>
> **Humans:** Ancestors with more flexible hands could make tools and grip objects. They survived better. Over generations, the human POPULATION developed dexterous hands.
>
> Same bones, different selection pressures = different shapes. Natural selection modified what was inherited from the common ancestor.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Different environments caused different selection pressures. Whales needed to swim, humans needed to grab things.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> They live in different places.

---

## Station 1: Comparative Anatomy Analysis (20 pts)

### Station 1 Q3: Evidence Interpretation (5 pts)
**Question:** What does shared bone pattern in whales, bats, dogs, and humans suggest about evolutionary history? Why would animals in different environments have the same bone structure?

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Explains common ancestor with bone pattern modification over time
- 4 pts: Mentions common ancestor correctly
- 3 pts: Partial explanation
- 2 pts: Vague response
- 1 pt: Incorrect
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> The fact that whales, bats, dogs, and humans all have the same bone pattern (humerus → radius/ulna → carpals → 5 digits) suggests they all evolved from a COMMON ANCESTOR. This ancestor had this arm structure, and as different groups spread to different environments, natural selection modified the shape for different functions:
> - Whales: flattened into flippers for swimming
> - Bats: elongated fingers with membrane for flying
> - Dogs: sturdy for running
> - Humans: flexible for manipulating objects
>
> The bones are HOMOLOGOUS - same structure, different function. If these animals evolved completely separately, they wouldn't all have this same bone pattern. The shared pattern is evidence of common ancestry.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> They share a common ancestor. The same bones got shaped differently for different uses over time through natural selection.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> They all have bones because they're all animals.

---

### Station 1 Q5: Week 1 Spiral - Natural Selection (3 pts)
**Question:** Use natural selection to explain: How did the same ancestral arm bone pattern become a flipper (in whales), a wing (in bats), and a digging claw (in moles)?

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Correctly applies natural selection mechanism from Week 1
- 2 pts: Mentions selection but incomplete mechanism
- 1 pt: Vague connection
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Natural selection shaped the same bones differently for each environment:
>
> **Whales:** In the ancestral population, some individuals were BORN with slightly more paddle-like limbs (variation already existed in DNA). In water, these individuals swam faster, caught more food, and escaped predators. They had more offspring. Over millions of generations, flipper-shaped limbs became common in the whale population.
>
> **Bats:** Individuals born with longer finger bones and skin between them could glide better. They caught more insects. Over generations, wings became the norm.
>
> **Moles:** Individuals with wider, stronger forelimbs could dig better and find more worms. They survived and reproduced more. Over time, digging claws dominated.
>
> KEY: The variation was ALREADY in the population. Natural selection didn't create new bones - it selected from existing variation.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Different environments selected for different limb shapes. Whales needed flippers to swim, so those with more paddle-like limbs survived better.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> They adapted to their environments.

**RED FLAG:** "They adapted" without mechanism - push for HOW (variation → selection → reproduction → population change).

## Station 2: Fossil Record Investigation (20 pts)

### Station 2 Q3: Predict Intermediate Fossil (5 pts)
**Question:** Predict what a fossil from 49.5 million years ago (between Pakicetus and Ambulocetus) would look like. Describe legs, feet, tail, and habitat.

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Predicts BOTH intermediate structure AND intermediate habitat/behavior
- 4 pts: Predicts intermediate structure OR habitat
- 3 pts: Reasonable prediction with less detail
- 2 pts: Vague prediction
- 1 pt: No scientific reasoning
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> A fossil from 49.5 million years ago would be INTERMEDIATE between Pakicetus (land mammal, 50 mya) and Ambulocetus (semi-aquatic, 49 mya). I would predict:
>
> - **Legs:** Four legs, but slightly shorter than Pakicetus. The legs would still be strong enough for walking but show early adaptations for swimming.
> - **Feet:** Larger feet than Pakicetus with EARLY webbing between toes - not fully webbed like Ambulocetus, but starting to develop.
> - **Tail:** Longer and more muscular than Pakicetus, beginning to flatten for swimming propulsion, but not yet the powerful swimming tail of later whales.
> - **Habitat:** Lived on land but spent significant time in shallow water - more aquatic than Pakicetus but less than Ambulocetus. Probably hunted both on land and in water.
>
> Each feature is INTERMEDIATE - not fully land-adapted like Pakicetus, not fully semi-aquatic like Ambulocetus. Evolution is gradual.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> It would have 4 legs starting to get webbed feet. Lived both on land and in water. Tail would be getting bigger for swimming.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> It would be halfway between them.

---

### Station 2 Q4: Evidence Evaluation (4 pts)
**Question:** Someone claims: "There are no transitional fossils - evolution has no evidence." Using whale evolution, explain why this claim is incorrect.

**Rubric:**
- 4 pts: Refutes claim with specific fossil evidence
- 3 pts: Refutes with general fossil evidence
- 2 pts: Recognizes claim is wrong but weak evidence
- 1 pt: Accepts the claim
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> This claim is completely incorrect. The whale fossil record is one of the best-documented transitional sequences in paleontology:
>
> 1. **Pakicetus (50 mya):** Four-legged land mammal, lived near water
> 2. **Ambulocetus (49 mya):** Could walk AND swim, had webbed feet - literally "walking whale"
> 3. **Rodhocetus (47 mya):** Shorter legs, large tail, mostly aquatic
> 4. **Basilosaurus (40 mya):** Tiny, non-functional back legs, fully aquatic
> 5. **Modern whales:** Flippers, no visible legs (but tiny hip bones inside!)
>
> We can literally SEE the gradual transition from land mammal to whale. Each fossil is intermediate between the one before and after. This IS transitional evidence - we can watch evolution happening through the fossil record.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> There ARE transitional fossils. Ambulocetus had both legs AND swimming adaptations, which proves that whales evolved from land animals over millions of years.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> There are fossils that show evolution.

## Station 3: Design a Transitional Form (25 pts)

### Station 3 Q1: Limb Design (5 pts)
**Question:** Describe the LIMBS of your transitional organism (60 mya). The ancestor had 4 legs, the descendant has flippers. What would the in-between look like?

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Intermediate limbs + explains selection pressure for change
- 4 pts: Intermediate limbs with partial explanation
- 3 pts: Reasonable intermediate design
- 2 pts: Either fully land OR fully aquatic (not intermediate)
- 1 pt: No scientific basis
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> **Front limbs:** Shorter than the ancestor's legs but not yet flippers. The "hand" would be wider and flatter, with webbing between the toes for paddling. The elbow would still bend but with limited range. These limbs could both push against the ground for limited walking AND paddle through water.
>
> **Back limbs:** Smaller than the ancestor's but still visible. The feet would be large and paddle-like for swimming propulsion, but the legs could still support the animal's weight on land for short periods.
>
> **Selection pressure:** Individuals with more paddle-like limbs could catch fish more efficiently in shallow water. They survived better and had more offspring, so over generations, the limbs became more aquatic.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> The limbs would be shorter legs with webbed feet. Good for both walking a little and swimming a lot.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> Flippers.

**RED FLAG:** If answer is "flippers" - that's the descendant, not transitional. Push for INTERMEDIATE features.

---

### Station 3 Q2: Body Covering Design (5 pts)
**Question:** Describe the BODY COVERING of your transitional organism. Ancestor had fur, descendant has smooth skin. What would be advantageous in between?

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Intermediate covering + explains selective advantage
- 4 pts: Intermediate covering with partial explanation
- 3 pts: Reasonable intermediate design
- 2 pts: Either fully furred OR fully smooth
- 1 pt: No scientific basis
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> **Body covering:** Sparse, short fur - not the thick coat of the land ancestor, but not fully smooth like modern whales either.
>
> **Characteristics:**
> - Fur would be shorter and more water-resistant
> - Some areas (like the belly) might already be nearly hairless
> - The fur would provide some insulation on land but not create too much drag in water
>
> **Selective advantage:** This intermediate covering works for an animal spending time in BOTH environments. On land, the thin fur provides some insulation. In water, the reduced fur creates less drag while still providing some warmth. Over generations, individuals with less fur swam faster and caught more food, so fur became even sparser until it disappeared.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> Thin, short fur that would be somewhat waterproof. Less fur than the ancestor but not smooth yet.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> Some fur.

---

### Station 3 Q3: Behavior and Habitat (5 pts)
**Question:** Describe the HABITAT and BEHAVIOR of your transitional organism. Where did it live? What did it eat? How did it move?

**Rubric:**
- 5 pts: Intermediate habitat + specific behaviors + explains why
- 4 pts: Intermediate habitat and behaviors
- 3 pts: Reasonable intermediate lifestyle
- 2 pts: Either fully land OR fully water
- 1 pt: No scientific basis
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (5/5)
> **Habitat:** Coastal areas - the boundary between land and sea. Spent most time in shallow water (like modern sea otters or seals) but could still come onto land to rest, give birth, and escape predators.
>
> **Diet:** Primarily fish and shellfish caught in shallow water. The transitional organism would hunt by chasing fish (using paddle-like limbs) rather than ambushing on land like its ancestor.
>
> **Movement:**
> - In water: Undulating body motion with paddle-feet, somewhat clumsy but effective
> - On land: Awkward waddling, similar to modern seals - could move but not fast or gracefully
>
> **Why intermediate:** An animal at 60 mya would be between the land-dwelling Pakicetus and fully aquatic modern whales. It would need both environments - water for feeding, land for safety and reproduction.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> Lived in shallow water near the coast. Ate fish. Could swim and walk but wasn't great at either.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> In the ocean.

---

### Station 3 Q4: Natural Selection Explanation (7 pts)
**Question:** Using NATURAL SELECTION, explain how your transitional form would evolve into the fully aquatic descendant. Include variation, selection pressure, and population change over time.

**Rubric:**
- 7 pts: Complete mechanism: variation → selection pressure → survival/reproduction → trait spread
- 5 pts: Mentions most elements of natural selection
- 3 pts: Partial mechanism
- 1 pt: No mechanism, just "it evolved"
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (7/7)
> Natural selection would transform my transitional organism (60 mya) into the fully aquatic descendant through these steps:
>
> 1. **VARIATION EXISTS:** In the transitional population, some individuals were born with slightly shorter legs, more webbed feet, or smoother skin than others. This variation was ALREADY in their DNA - they didn't create it by swimming more.
>
> 2. **SELECTION PRESSURE:** The ocean environment created pressure. Individuals who could swim faster caught more fish, escaped predators, and found mates more easily. Better swimmers had an advantage.
>
> 3. **DIFFERENTIAL SURVIVAL:** Individuals with more aquatic features (shorter legs, more webbed feet, smoother skin) survived better and had more offspring. Individuals with more land-adapted features died younger or had fewer offspring.
>
> 4. **INHERITANCE:** The better swimmers passed their genes to offspring. Over thousands of generations, genes for aquatic features became more common.
>
> 5. **POPULATION CHANGE:** After millions of years, the population looked completely different. Legs became flippers, fur disappeared, and the body became fully streamlined. The POPULATION evolved; individual organisms did not change during their lifetimes.
>
> KEY POINT: No individual "decided" to become aquatic. Natural selection simply favored certain traits that were already present.

### Acceptable (4/7)
> Some were born with better swimming traits, they survived more, had more babies, and over time the population became more aquatic. Individuals didn't change themselves.

### Insufficient (1/7)
> They changed to survive in the water and evolved.

**RED FLAG:** "They changed to survive" = Lamarckian misconception. The POPULATION changed because individuals WITH traits survived, not because individuals changed their traits.

## Exit Ticket: Evidence Integration (23 pts)

### Exit Q1: Define Homologous Structures (4 pts)
**Question:** Define HOMOLOGOUS STRUCTURES and give an example. Explain why they're evidence for evolution.

**Rubric:**
- 4 pts: Correct definition + example + explains why it's evidence for common ancestry
- 3 pts: Correct definition + example
- 2 pts: Partial definition
- 1 pt: Confused with analogous
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> **Definition:** Homologous structures are body parts in different organisms that have the SAME underlying STRUCTURE (bone pattern, arrangement) but different FUNCTIONS.
>
> **Example:** A whale flipper, bat wing, dog leg, and human arm all have the same bones: humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, and five digits. But they're used for swimming, flying, running, and manipulating - completely different functions.
>
> **Why it's evidence for evolution:** If these animals evolved independently, there's no reason they would all have the exact same bone pattern. The shared structure suggests they all inherited it from a COMMON ANCESTOR that had this limb design. Natural selection then modified the shape for each species' environment. Homologous = same origin, different use.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> Homologous structures are body parts with the same structure but different function. Like whale flippers and human arms both have the same bones. This shows they share a common ancestor.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> Body parts that do the same thing.

**RED FLAG:** "Same thing" = describing analogous, not homologous. Homologous = same STRUCTURE, different FUNCTION.

---

### Exit Q5: Integration (4 pts)
**Question:** Respond to "Evolution is just a guess - there's no real evidence."

**Rubric (3D Assessment):**
- 4 pts: Uses Week 1 natural selection + Week 2 anatomical evidence together
- 3 pts: Uses one type of evidence well
- 2 pts: Mentions both but doesn't connect
- 1 pt: Vague response
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (4/4)
> Evolution has MULTIPLE independent lines of evidence:
>
> **Week 1 - Natural Selection Observed:**
> - The cheetah-gazelle simulation showed how selection pressure changes trait frequency
> - The bean simulation demonstrated that variation + selection = population change over generations
> - We calculated how F=ma creates real selection pressure
>
> **Week 2 - Anatomical Evidence:**
> - Homologous structures: Whale flippers, bat wings, and human arms have the SAME BONES despite different functions. This only makes sense if they share a common ancestor.
> - The bone pattern couldn't have evolved independently in the exact same arrangement.
>
> **Week 2 - Fossil Evidence:**
> - Transitional fossils like Ambulocetus show the ACTUAL intermediate stages between land mammals and whales
> - We can literally see the sequence: Pakicetus (4 legs) → Ambulocetus (swimming + walking) → Basilosaurus (tiny legs) → modern whales (no legs)
>
> This isn't one piece of evidence - it's CONVERGENT evidence from observation, anatomy, and fossils all pointing to the same conclusion.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> We have evidence: we saw natural selection work in simulations (Week 1), homologous structures show common ancestry, and transitional fossils show evolution happening.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> There is evidence like fossils and bones.

---

### Exit Q6: Dolphin/Shark Explanation (3 pts)
**Question:** How can dolphins (mammals) and sharks (fish) look so similar? What type of structures are their body shapes?

**Rubric:**
- 3 pts: Clear explanation with evidence + mechanism
- 2 pts: Explanation with partial evidence
- 1 pt: Vague explanation
- 0 pts: No response

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Dolphins and sharks look similar because they face the SAME environmental challenge: moving efficiently through water. This is called **convergent evolution** - two unrelated groups evolving similar features independently.
>
> Their streamlined body shapes are **ANALOGOUS structures** - same FUNCTION (swimming), but completely DIFFERENT underlying structure:
> - **Dolphins:** Mammals with internal bones, warm blood, breathe air, give live birth, horizontal tail fluke
> - **Sharks:** Fish with cartilage skeleton, cold blood, breathe through gills, lay eggs, vertical tail fin
>
> Natural selection favored streamlined shapes in BOTH groups because that's what works best for moving through water. But they evolved these shapes from completely different ancestors - dolphins from land mammals, sharks from ancient fish.
>
> Similar appearance ≠ common ancestor. You have to look at the STRUCTURE, not just the function.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> They evolved similar shapes independently because both need to swim. It's analogous structures - same function, different structure. Not from common ancestor.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> They're both streamlined for swimming.

# Grading Calibration Notes

## What Distinguishes Exemplar from Acceptable

1. **Scientific vocabulary** used correctly and specifically
2. **Mechanism** explained, not just phenomenon described
3. **Connection** to prior learning (Week 1, Cycle 2)
4. **Misconception** explicitly addressed (especially Lamarckian)
5. **Evidence** cited specifically, not vaguely
6. **Quantitative reasoning** where applicable
7. **Multiple elements** addressed when question asks for them

## Red Flags for Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Red Flag Language | Correct Response |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Lamarckian evolution** | "it changed to adapt," "stretched to become," "developed in order to," "learned to" | Individuals don't change; POPULATIONS change because individuals WITH traits survive |
| **Individual evolution** | "the whale evolved" | "the whale POPULATION evolved" over generations |
| **Positive = good** | "positive feedback is helpful" | Positive = amplifying (can be harmful) |
| **Simple cause-effect** | Missing the LOOP back | Feedback = output becomes new input |
| **Homologous = analogous** | "same function" for homologous | Homologous = same STRUCTURE, different function |
| **Vague mechanism** | "it adapted," "they evolved" | HOW? Variation → selection → reproduction → population change |

## Point Allocation Guidelines

| Response Quality | Point Range | Key Features |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Exemplar | 90-100% | All elements, mechanism, vocabulary, connections |
| Acceptable | 60-80% | Core concept correct, may lack depth |
| Insufficient | 20-40% | Major gaps or misconceptions |

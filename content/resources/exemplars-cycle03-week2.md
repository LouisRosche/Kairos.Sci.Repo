# Grade 7: Feedback Loops & Tipping Points

## Hook Q4: Week 1 Connection (3 pts)
**Question:** How does the greenhouse effect (CO2 trapping heat) connect to this ice-melting feedback loop?

### Exemplar (3/3)
> The greenhouse effect starts the feedback loop. CO2 in the atmosphere absorbs infrared radiation (like we learned in Week 1), which warms the Earth. This warming causes ice to melt. When ice melts, it exposes dark ocean water, which has lower albedo and absorbs more heat. This makes the Earth even warmer, which melts more ice. So the greenhouse effect is the initial cause, and the ice-albedo feedback amplifies it.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> CO2 traps heat which makes ice melt. Then when ice melts, more heat gets absorbed.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> They both involve heat.

---

## Station 1 Q3: Explain Albedo Pattern (5 pts)
**Question:** Using the concept of ALBEDO, explain WHY some surfaces heated more than others.

### Exemplar (5/5)
> Black paper heated the most because dark colors have LOW albedo - they absorb most of the light energy instead of reflecting it. When light energy is absorbed, it converts to thermal energy, making the molecules vibrate faster (like we learned in Week 1). This is why the temperature increased so much.
>
> Aluminum foil heated the least because it has HIGH albedo - it reflects most of the light back. The energy never enters the material, so the molecules don't speed up.
>
> White paper is in between because it reflects more than black but less than foil.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> Dark colors absorb more light and get hotter. Light colors reflect light and stay cooler. Albedo measures how much light reflects.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> Black gets hot and white stays cool because black is a hotter color.

---

## Station 1 Q5: Ice-Albedo Feedback Application (3 pts)
**Question:** Complete the feedback loop: Ice (high albedo) → Ice melts → Ocean exposed (low albedo) → ???

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Ice (high albedo) → Ice melts → Dark ocean exposed (low albedo) → Ocean absorbs more sunlight → Water temperature rises → More ice melts → Even more dark ocean exposed → [cycle continues]
>
> This is a POSITIVE feedback loop because the change (warming/melting) amplifies itself. Each cycle makes the next one stronger.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Ocean absorbs more light → gets warmer → more ice melts. It's positive feedback.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> The ocean gets warmer.

---

## Station 2 Q4: Identify the Feedback (4 pts)
**Question:** Complete: More CO2 → Warmer climate → Ocean absorbs LESS CO2 → ??? Is this positive or negative feedback?

### Exemplar (4/4)
> More CO2 → Warmer climate → Ocean absorbs LESS CO2 → MORE CO2 stays in atmosphere → Even warmer climate → [cycle continues]
>
> This is POSITIVE feedback (amplifying, not "good"). The original change (more CO2) causes effects that lead to even MORE of that change. Positive feedback means the system pushes itself further in the same direction.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> More CO2 stays in air → warmer → absorbs even less. It's positive feedback because it makes itself worse.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> This is negative feedback because CO2 is bad.

---

## Station 3 Q3: Scientific Justification (8 pts)
**Question:** Explain HOW your system captures CO2, WHERE the carbon goes, and HOW LONG it stays stored.

### Exemplar (8/8)
> **HOW:** My system uses trees to capture CO2. Trees do photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2. The carbon atoms from CO2 get rearranged into glucose molecules. Then glucose gets converted into cellulose, which is what wood is made of.
>
> **WHERE:** The carbon goes into the tree's trunk, branches, roots, and leaves as cellulose (wood) and other organic molecules. Some carbon also ends up in the soil when leaves decompose. The carbon atoms from atmospheric CO2 become carbon atoms in solid wood.
>
> **HOW LONG:** Trees store carbon for decades to centuries - as long as the tree is alive. A 100-year-old oak has been storing carbon for 100 years. BUT if the tree burns or decomposes, the carbon returns to the atmosphere as CO2. So the storage isn't permanent unless we protect the forest from fire and cutting.

### Acceptable (5/8)
> Trees absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and store it in their wood. The carbon stays there until the tree dies or burns. It could last 50+ years.

### Insufficient (2/8)
> Trees are good for the environment and absorb carbon. It helps with climate change.

## Exit Ticket Q5: Integration (4 pts)
**Question:** Explain how greenhouse effect, ice-albedo feedback, and carbon sink feedback connect and amplify each other.

### Exemplar (4/4)
> These three processes create interconnected positive feedback loops:
>
> 1. **Greenhouse effect** (Week 1): CO2 absorbs infrared radiation, making molecules vibrate and trapping heat. This warms the Earth.
>
> 2. **Ice-albedo feedback** (Week 2): Warming melts ice, exposing dark ocean (low albedo), which absorbs more heat, causing more warming and more melting.
>
> 3. **Carbon sink feedback** (Week 2): Warming makes oceans absorb less CO2 (warm water holds less gas), so more CO2 stays in the atmosphere, causing more greenhouse effect.
>
> They amplify each other: Greenhouse effect → warming → ice melts AND oceans absorb less → more CO2 in air → stronger greenhouse effect → more warming. It's a system of positive feedbacks pushing in the same direction.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> All three cause warming that makes itself worse. CO2 traps heat, melting ice absorbs more heat, and warm oceans absorb less CO2.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> They all involve heat and climate change.

---

## Exit Ticket Q6: Feedback Model (3 pts)
**Question:** Create a feedback loop model in text format for ice-albedo feedback.

### Exemplar (3/3)
```
Temperature rises → Ice melts → Dark ocean exposed → More sunlight absorbed → Temperature rises more
       ↑                                                                              ↓
       ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←← (Loop continues - more melting, more absorption) ←←←←←←←←←←←←
```
> This is positive feedback because the OUTPUT (rising temperature) feeds back to AMPLIFY the original change. Each cycle makes the next cycle stronger. "Positive" means amplifying, not good.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Temp up → ice melts → ocean exposed → absorbs more → temp up → more melting
>
> (Shows the loop but missing the return arrow or "amplifying" explanation)

### Insufficient (1/3)
> Ice melts because it's hot. Then more ice melts.

# Grade 8: Evidence of Evolution

## Hook Q2: Initial Hypothesis (3 pts)
**Question:** Why might a whale have finger bones inside its flipper?

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Whales probably evolved from land mammals that had arms with fingers. Over millions of years, as whale ancestors moved into the ocean, natural selection favored individuals with limbs better suited for swimming. The arms gradually became flippers. But the basic bone pattern (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, digits) was passed down from the land-dwelling ancestor - it just got reshaped for a different function. The finger bones are "left over" from when whale ancestors walked on land.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> Whales evolved from animals that had fingers. The bones stayed but changed shape for swimming.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> Maybe whales used to walk.

---

## Station 1 Q3: Evidence Interpretation (5 pts)
**Question:** What does shared bone pattern in whales, bats, dogs, and humans suggest about evolutionary history?

### Exemplar (5/5)
> The fact that whales, bats, dogs, and humans all have the same bone pattern (humerus → radius/ulna → carpals → 5 digits) suggests they all evolved from a COMMON ANCESTOR. This ancestor had this arm structure, and as different groups spread to different environments, natural selection modified the shape for different functions:
> - Whales: flattened into flippers for swimming
> - Bats: elongated fingers with membrane for flying
> - Dogs: sturdy for running
> - Humans: flexible for manipulating objects
>
> The bones are HOMOLOGOUS - same structure, different function. If these animals evolved completely separately, they wouldn't all have this same bone pattern. The shared pattern is evidence of common ancestry.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> They share a common ancestor. The same bones got shaped differently for different uses over time through natural selection.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> They all have bones because they're all animals.

---

## Station 1 Q4: Lamarckian Check (3 pts auto)
**Question:** Which correctly explains how whales got flippers? A) Individual changed by swimming more. B) Some born with better traits survived and reproduced.

### Correct Answer: B

**Why A is WRONG (common misconception):**
> An individual whale cannot change its DNA by swimming. If a whale swims a lot, its flippers don't change. And even if they did, it couldn't pass those changes to offspring because DNA doesn't work that way. This is called "Lamarckian evolution" and it's WRONG.

**Why B is CORRECT:**
> Some whale ancestors were BORN with limbs slightly better for swimming (this variation already existed in their DNA). These individuals caught more food, escaped predators better, and survived to have more offspring. Their offspring inherited the better-swimming trait. Over millions of years, the population changed because individuals with flippers kept surviving and reproducing more.

## Station 2 Q3: Predict Intermediate Fossil (5 pts)
**Question:** Predict what a fossil from 49.5 million years ago (between Pakicetus and Ambulocetus) would look like.

### Exemplar (5/5)
> A fossil from 49.5 million years ago would be INTERMEDIATE between Pakicetus (land mammal, 50 mya) and Ambulocetus (semi-aquatic, 49 mya). I would predict:
>
> - **Legs:** Four legs, but slightly shorter than Pakicetus. The legs would still be strong enough for walking but show early adaptations for swimming.
> - **Feet:** Larger feet than Pakicetus with EARLY webbing between toes - not fully webbed like Ambulocetus, but starting to develop.
> - **Tail:** Longer and more muscular than Pakicetus, beginning to flatten for swimming propulsion, but not yet the powerful swimming tail of later whales.
> - **Habitat:** Lived on land but spent significant time in shallow water - more aquatic than Pakicetus but less than Ambulocetus. Probably hunted both on land and in water.
>
> Each feature is INTERMEDIATE - not fully land-adapted like Pakicetus, not fully semi-aquatic like Ambulocetus. Evolution is gradual.

### Acceptable (3/5)
> It would have 4 legs starting to get webbed feet. Lived both on land and in water. Tail would be getting bigger for swimming.

### Insufficient (1/5)
> It would be halfway between them.

---

## Station 3 Q4: Natural Selection Explanation (7 pts)
**Question:** Explain how your transitional form would evolve into the fully aquatic descendant using natural selection.

### Exemplar (7/7)
> Natural selection would transform my transitional organism (60 mya) into the fully aquatic descendant through these steps:
>
> 1. **VARIATION EXISTS:** In the transitional population, some individuals were born with slightly shorter legs, more webbed feet, or smoother skin than others. This variation was ALREADY in their DNA - they didn't create it by swimming more.
>
> 2. **SELECTION PRESSURE:** The ocean environment created pressure. Individuals who could swim faster caught more fish, escaped predators, and found mates more easily. Better swimmers had an advantage.
>
> 3. **DIFFERENTIAL SURVIVAL:** Individuals with more aquatic features (shorter legs, more webbed feet, smoother skin) survived better and had more offspring. Individuals with more land-adapted features died younger or had fewer offspring.
>
> 4. **INHERITANCE:** The better swimmers passed their genes to offspring. Over thousands of generations, genes for aquatic features became more common.
>
> 5. **POPULATION CHANGE:** After millions of years, the population looked completely different. Legs became flippers, fur disappeared, and the body became fully streamlined. The POPULATION evolved; individual organisms did not change during their lifetimes.
>
> KEY POINT: No individual "decided" to become aquatic. Natural selection simply favored certain traits that were already present.

### Acceptable (4/7)
> Some were born with better swimming traits, they survived more, had more babies, and over time the population became more aquatic. Individuals didn't change themselves.

### Insufficient (1/7)
> They changed to survive in the water and evolved.

---

## Exit Ticket Q5: Integration (4 pts)
**Question:** Respond to "Evolution is just a guess - there's no real evidence."

### Exemplar (4/4)
> Evolution has MULTIPLE independent lines of evidence:
>
> **Week 1 - Natural Selection Observed:**
> - The cheetah-gazelle simulation showed how selection pressure changes trait frequency
> - The bean simulation demonstrated that variation + selection = population change over generations
> - We calculated how F=ma creates real selection pressure
>
> **Week 2 - Anatomical Evidence:**
> - Homologous structures: Whale flippers, bat wings, and human arms have the SAME BONES despite different functions. This only makes sense if they share a common ancestor.
> - The bone pattern couldn't have evolved independently in the exact same arrangement.
>
> **Week 2 - Fossil Evidence:**
> - Transitional fossils like Ambulocetus show the ACTUAL intermediate stages between land mammals and whales
> - We can literally see the sequence: Pakicetus (4 legs) → Ambulocetus (swimming + walking) → Basilosaurus (tiny legs) → modern whales (no legs)
>
> This isn't one piece of evidence - it's CONVERGENT evidence from observation, anatomy, and fossils all pointing to the same conclusion.

### Acceptable (3/4)
> We have evidence: we saw natural selection work in simulations (Week 1), homologous structures show common ancestry, and transitional fossils show evolution happening.

### Insufficient (1/4)
> There is evidence like fossils and bones.

## Exit Ticket Q6: Dolphin/Shark Explanation (3 pts)
**Question:** How can dolphins (mammals) and sharks (fish) look so similar?

### Exemplar (3/3)
> Dolphins and sharks look similar because they face the SAME environmental challenge: moving efficiently through water. This is called **convergent evolution** - two unrelated groups evolving similar features independently.
>
> Their streamlined body shapes are **ANALOGOUS structures** - same FUNCTION (swimming), but completely DIFFERENT underlying structure:
> - **Dolphins:** Mammals with internal bones, warm blood, breathe air, give live birth, horizontal tail fluke
> - **Sharks:** Fish with cartilage skeleton, cold blood, breathe through gills, lay eggs, vertical tail fin
>
> Natural selection favored streamlined shapes in BOTH groups because that's what works best for moving through water. But they evolved these shapes from completely different ancestors - dolphins from land mammals, sharks from ancient fish.
>
> Similar appearance ≠ common ancestor. You have to look at the STRUCTURE, not just the function.

### Acceptable (2/3)
> They evolved similar shapes independently because both need to swim. It's analogous structures - same function, different structure. Not from common ancestor.

### Insufficient (1/3)
> They're both streamlined for swimming.

# Grading Calibration Notes

## What Distinguishes Exemplar from Acceptable:

1. **Scientific vocabulary** used correctly and specifically
2. **Mechanism** explained, not just phenomenon described
3. **Connection** to prior learning (Week 1, Cycle 2)
4. **Misconception** explicitly addressed (especially Lamarckian)
5. **Evidence** cited specifically, not vaguely

## Red Flags for Misconceptions:

- **Lamarckian language:** "it changed to adapt," "stretched to become," "developed in order to"
- **Individual evolution:** "the whale evolved" instead of "the population evolved"
- **Positive = good:** "positive feedback is helpful"
- **Feedback = simple cause-effect:** Missing the LOOP back to the original cause

## How to Use These Exemplars:

1. **Before grading:** Read exemplars to calibrate expectations
2. **During grading:** Compare student responses to exemplar elements
3. **For feedback:** Quote exemplar elements students are missing
4. **With students:** Show anonymized exemplars as models (after deadline)

## NGSS Alignment

### Primary Standard
**MS-LS2-4:** Construct an argument supported by empirical evidence that changes to physical or biological components of an ecosystem affect populations.

### Secondary Standard (Integrated from Deferred C9)
**MS-ESS1-2:** Develop and use a model to describe the role of gravity in the motions within galaxies and the solar system.
*Integration context: Earth's place in solar system and how cosmic factors affect life on Earth*

### Spiral Standards
| Standard | Description | From Cycle |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| MS-ESS1-4 | Geologic time scale | Cycle 7 |
| MS-ESS3-5 | Climate change factors | Cycle 3 |
| MS-ESS3-3 | Human impact | Cycle 4 |

### 3-Dimensional Learning
- **SEP:** Engaging in Argument (SEP-7), Constructing Explanations (SEP-6), All SEPs (Year-End)
- **DCI:** LS2.A Interdependent Relationships, LS2.C Ecosystem Dynamics, ESS1.B Earth and Solar System
- **CCC:** Stability and Change (CCC-7), Cause and Effect (CCC-2), All CCCs (Year-End Synthesis)

## Anchoring Phenomenon

**Why did removing wolves from Yellowstone change the rivers?**

When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995, something unexpected happened: the rivers changed their course. This "trophic cascade" reveals how interconnected ecosystems truly are—predators at the top affect everything down to the physical landscape.

## Week-by-Week Structure

### Week 1: Ecosystem Dynamics & Trophic Cascades
**Phenomenon:** Why did removing wolves from Yellowstone change the rivers?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Wolves and Rivers Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Trophic Cascade Simulation | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Food Web Analysis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design an Ecosystem Intervention | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Ecosystem Dynamics Integration | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Explain how energy flows through trophic levels
2. Model cascading effects through food webs
3. Predict ecosystem changes from species removal/addition
4. Design interventions for ecosystem restoration

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Ecosystems are stable" → Dynamic with fluctuating populations
- "Food chains are linear" → Complex interconnected webs
- "Predators are bad for ecosystems" → Keystone species maintain balance

### Week 2: Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services
**Phenomenon:** How can one small change collapse an entire ecosystem?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Pollinator Crisis Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Biodiversity & Resilience | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Ecosystem Services Valuation | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design a Conservation Plan | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Biodiversity Integration | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Explain why biodiversity increases ecosystem resilience
2. Identify ecosystem services and their value
3. Connect human activities to biodiversity loss
4. Design evidence-based conservation strategies

### Week 3: Year-End Integration
**Phenomenon:** Student-selected ecosystem investigation + CCC synthesis

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Day 1: CCC Synthesis | Cross-Cutting Concept Review | 40 | Full period |
| Day 2: Student Presentations | Investigation Showcases | 40 | Full period |
| Day 3: Cycle 8 Assessment | Final Cumulative Assessment | 20 | As needed |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Apply cross-cutting concepts across all cycles
2. Present independent investigation findings
3. Demonstrate integrated understanding of year content
4. Reflect on scientific thinking development

## Year-End Integration Components

### Cross-Cutting Concept Synthesis
Students demonstrate mastery of all 7 CCCs through ecosystem lens:

| CCC | Application to Ecosystems |
|-----|---------------------------|
| 1. Patterns | Population cycles, migration, seasonal changes |
| 2. Cause & Effect | Trophic cascades, extinction chains |
| 3. Scale, Proportion, Quantity | Energy transfer efficiency, population sizes |
| 4. Systems & System Models | Food webs, nutrient cycles |
| 5. Energy & Matter | Energy flow, matter cycling |
| 6. Structure & Function | Adaptations, niches |
| 7. Stability & Change | Ecosystem resilience, succession |

### Student Investigation Showcase
Students present independent investigations started earlier in the year:
- 3-5 minute presentation per student
- Evidence-based conclusions required
- Peer review and feedback
- Connection to at least 2 cycles

## Week 1 Rubrics: Ecosystem Dynamics & Trophic Cascades

### Station 1: Trophic Cascade
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** LS2.C | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Explain how removing wolves from Yellowstone affected the rivers. Include at least 3 steps in the cascade.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | 3+ steps + mechanism + landscape connection | "1) Wolves removed → 2) Elk population exploded → 3) Elk overgrazed riverbanks → 4) Vegetation died → 5) River banks eroded → 6) Rivers widened and changed course. Without predators, elk had no reason to move, so they ate everything in one area." |
| **3** | 3 steps + partial mechanism | "Wolves gone → more elk → less plants → rivers changed." |
| **2** | 2 steps or missing connection | "No wolves meant more elk. This affected the environment." |
| **1** | 1 step or major errors | "Wolves ate the rivers." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Keystone Species
**SEP:** Engaging in Argument | **DCI:** LS2.A | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** What makes a species a "keystone" species? Use wolves as an example.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Definition + example + disproportionate effect | "A keystone species has an effect on the ecosystem much larger than its population size would suggest. Wolves are only ~100 individuals in Yellowstone, but they control elk behavior, which affects vegetation, which affects rivers, birds, and other species. Remove them, and the whole system changes." |
| **3** | Definition + example | "Keystone species have big effects despite small numbers. Wolves control elk which affects everything else." |
| **2** | Definition OR example | "Keystone species are really important to ecosystems." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Keystone species are the biggest animals." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Intervention Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** LS2.C | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Design an intervention to restore a prairie ecosystem that lost its prairie dogs.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Identifies keystone + intervention + cascade prediction + justification | "Prairie dogs are keystone species: their burrows provide homes for owls, aerate soil, and their grazing creates habitat diversity. Intervention: Reintroduce captive-bred prairie dogs. Expected cascade: 1) Burrows return → 2) Burrowing owls return → 3) Soil loosens → 4) Vegetation diversity increases. Evidence: Similar reintroductions in Montana showed population recovery in 5 years." |
| **4** | Identifies keystone + intervention + cascade | "Reintroduce prairie dogs. Their burrows will help owls and improve soil." |
| **3** | Intervention + partial reasoning | "Bring back prairie dogs because they're important." |
| **2** | Intervention without reasoning | "Add more animals." |
| **1** | Unrealistic intervention | "Just leave it alone forever." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services

### Station 1: Resilience
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** LS2.C | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** Why does a diverse ecosystem recover from disturbance faster than a monoculture?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Multiple mechanisms + example | "In a diverse ecosystem: 1) If one species is affected by disease, others survive to fill the role. 2) Different species have different tolerances, so some will survive any disturbance. 3) Genetic diversity within species provides adaptation options. A monoculture has none of these buffers—one disease can wipe out everything." |
| **3** | 1-2 mechanisms + reasoning | "Diverse ecosystems have backup species if one fails." |
| **2** | General answer | "More species means more resilience." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Monocultures are actually more stable." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Ecosystem Services
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** LS2.A | **CCC:** Systems

**Question:** A wetland provides $4,539/hectare/year in flood control. If a city destroys 100 hectares of wetland for development, what is the annual cost to replace this service?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct calculation + interpretation + additional services | "$4,539 × 100 = $453,900 per year just for flood control. But wetlands also provide water purification, wildlife habitat, and recreation—the true cost is much higher. The city would need to build expensive infrastructure to replace even one of these services." |
| **3** | Correct calculation + interpretation | "$453,900 per year. That's just for flood control—other services add more." |
| **2** | Correct calculation only | "$453,900" |
| **1** | Calculation error | Incorrect math |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3: Conservation Plan
**SEP:** Engaging in Argument | **DCI:** LS2.C | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** Argue for preserving a threatened wetland using evidence about ecosystem services.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Claim + multiple evidence types + counterargument + long-term view | "The wetland should be preserved because: 1) It provides $10M/year in ecosystem services (water purification, flood control). 2) It's habitat for 200 species including endangered ones. 3) Development could be located elsewhere with less environmental impact. Even if development brings jobs, the long-term cost of losing ecosystem services exceeds short-term gains." |
| **4** | Claim + multiple evidence types | "Preserve because of economic value and biodiversity." |
| **3** | Claim + one evidence type | "Preserve because it provides ecosystem services." |
| **2** | Claim without evidence | "We should save it because it's important." |
| **1** | No clear argument | "Wetlands are nice." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

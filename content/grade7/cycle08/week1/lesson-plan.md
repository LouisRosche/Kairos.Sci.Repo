# Grade 7 Cycle 8 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Ecosystem Dynamics & Trophic Cascades

**NGSS Standards:** MS-LS2-4 (Primary), MS-ESS1-4 & MS-ESS3-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Wolves and Rivers Mystery**
When wolves were hunted to extinction in Yellowstone by 1926, elk populations exploded. Elk overgrazed riverbanks, destroying vegetation. Rivers widened and meandered. When wolves were reintroduced in 1995, elk behavior changed, vegetation recovered, and rivers actually changed course. How can predators affect rivers?

**Driving Question:** Why did removing wolves from Yellowstone change the rivers?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain how energy flows through trophic levels
2. Model cascading effects through food webs
3. Predict ecosystem changes from species removal/addition
4. Design interventions for ecosystem restoration

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What major events changed ecosystems in geologic time?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Yellowstone wolf reintroduction video + before/after images
- **Driving Question:** How can predators affect the physical landscape?
- **Cycle 7 Connection:** "We learned about mass extinctions. What happens to ecosystems when key species disappear?"
- **Materials:** Yellowstone video (embedded)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on food chain basics (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show "How Wolves Change Rivers" video clip (4:30)
- Let students react before explaining trophic cascade
- "This wasn't expected—scientists call it a 'trophic cascade'"

### Station 1: Trophic Cascade Simulation (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Model cascading effects through food web
- **Activity:** Manipulate virtual food web simulation, track population changes
- **Key Vocabulary:** Trophic level, producer, consumer, apex predator, keystone species
- **Spiral Connection:** Geologic time and extinctions from Cycle 7

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- Food web simulation (embedded)
- Population tracking worksheet (embedded)

**Simulation Scenarios:**
1. Remove apex predator (wolves) → Track effects
2. Add invasive species → Track competition
3. Disease in primary producer → Track cascade

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Ecosystems are stable" | Constantly changing, populations fluctuate | Show population graphs |
| "Food chains are linear" | Complex webs, multiple connections | Web vs chain comparison |
| "Predators are harmful" | Keystone species maintain balance | Yellowstone example |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Energy flow and trophic cascades
- **Model:** Draw energy pyramid with 10% transfer
- **Think-Aloud:** Why does removing one species affect so many others?
- **Visual:** Yellowstone before/after comparison

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Energy decreases at each trophic level (10% rule)
2. Populations are interconnected through webs
3. Keystone species have disproportionate effects
4. Indirect effects can be stronger than direct effects

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Research other trophic cascade examples
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on ecosystem concepts

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What is a trophic cascade?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Food Web Analysis (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Analyze complex food web connections
- **Activity:** Map energy pathways and predict effects of changes
- **Spiral Connection:** Human impact from Cycle 4

**Analysis Framework:**
| Species Role | Example | If Removed... |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| Producer | Grass, algae | All consumers affected |
| Primary Consumer | Elk, insects | Predators decline, plants overgrow |
| Secondary Consumer | Wolves, birds | Prey populations explode |
| Decomposer | Fungi, bacteria | Nutrients don't recycle |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Which species would have the biggest impact if removed?
2. How does the 10% energy rule affect population sizes?
3. Can ecosystems recover after major disruptions?

### Station 3: Design an Ecosystem Intervention (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply understanding to restoration challenge
- **Activity:** Design intervention plan for degraded ecosystem
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-7 (Engaging in Argument) + Engineering Design

**Scenario:**
A local prairie ecosystem has lost its prairie dog population due to disease. Now:
- Hawks (predators) are declining
- Vegetation is becoming overgrown
- Burrowing owls have no nesting sites
- Soil is compacting without burrows

**Design Your Intervention:**
1. Identify the keystone species and its role
2. Propose intervention (reintroduce, substitute, manage)
3. Predict cascading effects of your intervention
4. Justify with evidence from simulation and case studies

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (trophic cascades and food webs)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 7: geologic changes; Cycle 4: human impact)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect extinctions to ecosystem change)
  - 1 SEP-7 question (Argue for intervention based on evidence)

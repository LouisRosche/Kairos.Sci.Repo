# Grade 7 Cycle 8 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Biodiversity & Ecosystem Services

**NGSS Standards:** MS-LS2-4 (Primary), MS-ESS3-3 & MS-ESS3-5 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Phenomenon

**The Pollinator Crisis Mystery**
Bee populations have declined by 40% in the last decade. Scientists estimate that 75% of crops depend on pollinators. If bees disappear, what happens to our food supply—and how might this cascade through ecosystems?

**Driving Question:** How can one small change collapse an entire ecosystem?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain why biodiversity increases ecosystem resilience
2. Identify ecosystem services and their economic value
3. Connect human activities to biodiversity loss
4. Design evidence-based conservation strategies

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What is a trophic cascade?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Pollinator decline data + crop dependency statistics
- **Driving Question:** What happens if pollinators disappear?
- **Week 1 Connection:** "We saw how wolves affected rivers. Could bees affect our food supply?"
- **Materials:** Pollinator decline infographic (embedded)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on ecosystem interconnections (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show the economic stakes: $235 billion in crops depend on pollinators
- Connect to personal experience (grocery store, gardens)
- "This is happening right now—not in the distant past"

### Station 1: Biodiversity & Resilience (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Explore how diversity buffers ecosystems against change
- **Activity:** Compare resilience of diverse vs. monoculture simulations
- **Key Vocabulary:** Biodiversity, resilience, monoculture, species richness
- **Spiral Connection:** Climate change impacts from Cycle 3

**Simulation Comparison:**
| Factor | Monoculture | Diverse Ecosystem |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Disease resistance | Low | High |
| Climate adaptation | Low | High |
| Pest vulnerability | High | Low |
| Recovery from disturbance | Slow | Fast |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Biodiversity is nice to have" | Essential for ecosystem services | Quantify the value |
| "We only need useful species" | All species contribute to web | Remove "useless" species in simulation |
| "Ecosystems recover quickly" | Recovery can take decades-centuries | Show succession data |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Ecosystem services and their value
- **Model:** Categorize services (provisioning, regulating, cultural, supporting)
- **Think-Aloud:** How do we put a value on nature?
- **Visual:** Ecosystem services value chart

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Provisioning: Food, water, materials
2. Regulating: Climate, water purification, pollination
3. Cultural: Recreation, spiritual, aesthetic
4. Supporting: Nutrient cycling, habitat, soil formation

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Why does biodiversity increase resilience?"
- Review ecosystem services categories
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Ecosystem Services Valuation (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Calculate economic value of ecosystem services
- **Activity:** Use valuation tool to estimate local ecosystem services
- **Spiral Connection:** Human impact from Cycle 4

**Valuation Exercise:**
| Service | Value per hectare/year | Local example |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|
| Pollination | $3,251 | Apple orchards |
| Water purification | $2,455 | Wetlands |
| Carbon storage | $1,987 | Forests |
| Flood control | $4,539 | Riparian zones |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Should we put a dollar value on nature?
2. What happens when we lose ecosystem services?
3. Who pays when ecosystems are destroyed?

### Station 3: Design a Conservation Plan (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply understanding to real conservation challenge
- **Activity:** Design evidence-based conservation strategy
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-7 (Engaging in Argument) + SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations)

**Scenario:**
A local wetland is threatened by development. The wetland provides:
- Habitat for 200+ species
- Water filtration for 50,000 people
- Flood control during storms
- Recreation for the community

**Conservation Plan Must Include:**
1. Argument for preservation (evidence-based)
2. Alternative solutions for development needs
3. Long-term sustainability plan
4. Stakeholder considerations

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (biodiversity and ecosystem services)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 3: climate factors; Cycle 4: human impact)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect Week 1 cascades to biodiversity)
  - 1 SEP-7 question (Argue for conservation using evidence)

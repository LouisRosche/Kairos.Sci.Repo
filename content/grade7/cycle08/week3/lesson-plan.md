# Grade 7 Cycle 8 Week 3 Lesson Plan
## Year-End Integration & Assessment

**NGSS Standards:** MS-LS2-4 (Primary) + All Year Standards (Synthesis)
**Duration:** 3 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Focus
Year-End Integration: CCC Synthesis + Student Investigations + Final Assessment

---

## Special Structure: Year-End Integration Week

This week combines Cycle 8 content assessment with Year-End Integration activities:
- **Day 1:** Cross-Cutting Concept Synthesis
- **Day 2:** Student Investigation Presentations
- **Day 3:** Cycle 8 Cumulative Assessment + Year Reflection

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Apply all 7 cross-cutting concepts to ecosystem analysis
2. Present independent investigation findings with evidence
3. Demonstrate integrated understanding of year content
4. Reflect on scientific thinking development

---

## Day 1: Cross-Cutting Concept Synthesis (40 pts)

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Overview of Year-End Integration Week
- Explain CCC synthesis expectations
- "Today we'll show how the 7 big ideas of science apply to ecosystems"

### CCC Ecosystem Analysis (60 min | 40 pts)

Students work in groups to analyze how each CCC applies to Yellowstone ecosystem:

| CCC | Ecosystem Application | Points |
|-----|----------------------|--------|
| **1. Patterns** | Population cycles (elk, wolves), migration patterns, seasonal changes | 5 |
| **2. Cause & Effect** | Wolf removal → elk increase → vegetation loss → river change | 6 |
| **3. Scale, Proportion, Quantity** | Energy transfer (10% rule), population sizes, trophic levels | 6 |
| **4. Systems & System Models** | Food web diagram, nutrient cycling models | 5 |
| **5. Energy & Matter** | Energy flow through trophic levels, matter cycling | 6 |
| **6. Structure & Function** | Wolf teeth for hunting, elk hooves for grazing | 6 |
| **7. Stability & Change** | Ecosystem before/after wolves, succession | 6 |

**Group Presentation Requirements:**
- Each group presents 1-2 CCCs
- Must include specific Yellowstone examples
- Connect to at least one other cycle's content
- 5-7 minutes per group

### Reflection & Connections (10 min)
- Whole-class discussion: Which CCC surprised you the most?
- Preview tomorrow's student investigations

---

## Day 2: Student Investigation Presentations (40 pts)

### Investigation Showcase Structure

**Presentation Format:**
- 3-5 minutes per student
- Must include: Question, Methods, Evidence, Conclusions
- Connection to at least 2 cycles required
- Q&A from peers (1-2 questions)

**Investigation Rubric Summary:**
| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Clear research question | 5 |
| Evidence-based methods | 10 |
| Accurate conclusions | 10 |
| Connection to cycles | 10 |
| Presentation quality | 5 |
| **Total** | **40** |

**Peer Feedback:**
- Each student provides written feedback to 3 peers
- Focus on: Strengths, Questions, Connections
- Collected at end of day

### Presentation Schedule
- Groups of 4-5 students per rotation
- 25-30 minutes per rotation
- Transition time between groups

---

## Day 3: Cycle 8 Assessment + Year Reflection (20 pts)

### Cycle 8 Content Assessment (15 pts | 30 min)

**Section A: Ecosystem Dynamics (5 pts)**
- Trophic cascade explanation
- Food web analysis
- Keystone species identification

**Section B: Biodiversity & Services (5 pts)**
- Resilience explanation
- Ecosystem services valuation
- Conservation argument

**Section C: Integration (5 pts)**
- Connect ecosystems to previous cycles
- Apply CCCs to novel scenario
- System-level explanation

### Year-End Reflection (5 pts | 15 min)

Students complete reflection on their scientific growth:

**Reflection Prompts:**
1. What was the most surprising thing you learned this year?
2. Which science practice (SEP) did you improve the most?
3. How has your thinking about science changed?
4. What questions do you still have about Earth and life science?

## Assessment Structure Summary

| Component | Points | Day | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------|
| CCC Synthesis | 40 | Day 1 | Cross-cutting concepts |
| Student Investigation | 40 | Day 2 | Independent research |
| Cycle 8 Assessment | 15 | Day 3 | Content mastery |
| Year Reflection | 5 | Day 3 | Scientific identity |
| **Total** | **100** | | |

---

## MTSS Considerations

### Tier 1 (Universal)
- CCC reference sheet with definitions
- Presentation template with prompts
- Sentence starters for reflection

### Tier 2 (Targeted)
- Extended time for presentations
- Reduced CCC analysis (3-4 concepts)
- Guided investigation support

### Tier 3 (Intensive)
- One-on-one presentation option
- Modified assessment format
- Oral reflection alternative

---

## Materials List

### Digital Resources
- [ ] Chromebooks (class set)
- [ ] CCC synthesis template (embedded)
- [ ] Presentation software
- [ ] Peer feedback forms (embedded)
- [ ] Reflection template (embedded)

### Physical Materials

- Compare to beginning-of-year baseline
- Identify growth patterns across cycles

### Reporting
- Individual student growth reports
- Class summary for next year's teacher
- Standards mastery documentation

## Overview

Assessment week synthesizing Weeks 1-2 content on ocean acidification and eutrophication. Students demonstrate understanding of human impacts on water systems through a three-part assessment structure.

### Assessment Structure
| Part | Focus | Points | Time |

### Learning Targets Assessed
**From Week 1 (Ocean Acidification):**
1. Explain how CO2 dissolution causes ocean acidification

4. Design a monitoring system for ocean acidification

**From Week 2 (Eutrophication):**
1. Trace nitrogen and phosphorus through ecosystems
2. Explain the eutrophication cascade

## Data Collection Points

### MTSS Triggers
- Any student <60% overall → Tier 2 consideration
- Any student <40% overall → Tier 3 consideration
- Any question with >40% miss rate → Whole-class reteach

### Misconception Tracking
- Flag persistent misconceptions for Cycle 5 spiral
- Compare to W1/W2 performance to assess remediation effectiveness

### Spiral Effectiveness
- Compare Cycle 3 spiral question performance to original Cycle 3 scores
- Target: ≥60% retention

---

## Post-Assessment Actions

### Day 3 Data Review
1. Run MTSS intervention generator
2. Identify whole-class reteach needs
3. Flag Tier 2/3 students for next cycle support
4. Update misconception tracker

### Parent Communication
- Tier 3 students: Parent contact before Cycle 5
- Cycle assessment scores shared via Canvas

### Cycle 5 Preparation
- Adjust pacing based on concept retention
- Plan spiral questions targeting weak areas
- Update seating/grouping as needed

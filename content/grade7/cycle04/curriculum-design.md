## Anchoring Phenomenon

**Why are seashells dissolving in the ocean?**

Pteropod shells (sea butterflies) collected today are thinner and more fragile than shells from 50 years ago. Some are even dissolving. This connects directly to what students learned about CO₂ in Cycle 3.

## Week-by-Week Structure

### Week 1: Ocean Acidification Investigation
**Phenomenon:** Why is the ocean becoming more acidic?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Dissolving Shells Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | pH and Marine Life | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Carbon Sources and Sinks | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design a Monitoring System | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Ocean Chemistry Integration | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Explain how atmospheric CO₂ affects ocean pH
2. Interpret pH data and predict effects on marine life
3. Apply mass balance to ocean-atmosphere carbon exchange
4. Design a monitoring system for ocean acidification

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Ocean acidification is only from CO₂" → Multiple sources contribute
- "The ocean will become like battery acid" → pH change is small but significant
- "Marine life will just adapt" → Many organisms can't adapt fast enough

### Week 2: Eutrophication & Dead Zones
**Phenomenon:** What happens when nutrients run off into waterways?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Green Lake Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Nutrient Cycle Modeling | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Dead Zone Data Analysis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design a Remediation Plan | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Biogeochemical Systems | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Trace nitrogen and phosphorus through ecosystems
2. Explain the eutrophication cascade (nutrients → algae → decomposition → oxygen depletion)
3. Analyze real-world data from the Gulf of Mexico dead zone
4. Design a solution to minimize nutrient runoff

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "More nutrients are always better for ecosystems" → Excess causes eutrophication
- "Dead zones are permanent" → They can recover with intervention
- "This only affects ocean life" → Freshwater ecosystems also affected

### Week 3: Synthesis & Assessment
**Focus:** Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycle 3

| Component | Points | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Part 2: Cumulative Assessment | 60 | ~40 min |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min |

## Cycle 3 → Cycle 4 Connections

| Cycle 3 Concept | Cycle 4 Application |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| CO₂ and greenhouse effect | CO₂ dissolution in ocean → acidification |
| Carbon cycle | Carbon budget in ocean-atmosphere system |
| Feedback loops | Eutrophication cascade as positive feedback |
| Conservation of mass | Mass balance in nutrient cycling |

## MTSS Considerations

### Tier 1 (Universal)
- Sentence starters for all open-response questions
- Word banks with cycle-specific vocabulary
- Async alternatives with data tables

### Tier 2 (Targeted)
- Pre-built concept maps for carbon/nutrient cycles
- Step-by-step calculation guides
- Video alternatives for simulations

### Tier 3 (Intensive)
- Modified assessment with reduced question load
- One-on-one pH concept review
- Graphic organizers for system thinking

### Key Vocabulary
| Term | Definition | Station |
|------|------------|---------|
| Ocean acidification | Decrease in ocean pH from CO₂ absorption | W1 Hook |
| pH scale | Measure of acidity (0-14) | W1 S1 |
| Carbonic acid | Formed when CO₂ dissolves in water | W1 S1 |
| Eutrophication | Excess nutrients → algae bloom → oxygen depletion | W2 Hook |
| Dead zone | Area with too little oxygen to support life | W2 S2 |
| Biogeochemical cycle | Movement of elements through living and nonliving systems | W2 S1 |

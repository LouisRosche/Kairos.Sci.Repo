# Grade 7 Cycle 4: Ecosystems & Energy Flow
## PLACEHOLDER - To Be Developed

**Target NGSS Standards:**
- MS-LS2-1: Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability
- MS-LS2-3: Develop a model to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy
- MS-LS2-4: Construct an argument supported by evidence on how organism interactions affect populations

**Phenomenon:** [To be determined - suggest food web collapse scenario]

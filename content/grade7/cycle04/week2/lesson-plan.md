# Grade 7 Cycle 4 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Eutrophication & Dead Zones

**NGSS:** MS-ESS3-3 | **Duration:** 5 days | **Points:** 100

---

## Overview

Students investigate how excess nutrients from agricultural runoff cause eutrophication and dead zones, connecting to Week 1's ocean acidification and Cycle 3's feedback loops.

### Phenomenon
**What happens when nutrients run off into waterways?**
- 2014 Lake Erie algae bloom: 500,000 without drinking water
- Gulf of Mexico dead zone: 16,000+ km² of hypoxic water

### Learning Targets
1. Trace nitrogen and phosphorus through ecosystems
2. Explain the eutrophication cascade
3. Analyze real-world Gulf of Mexico data
4. Design remediation solutions

## Daily Schedule

### Day 1: Hook + Station 1 Setup
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5 min | Warm-up: Review Week 1 ocean acidification |
| 10 min | Hook: The Green Lake Mystery |
| 5 min | Transition + Station 1 intro |
| 18 min | Station 1: Nutrient Cycle Modeling |
| 7 min | Debrief + preview Day 2 |

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show Lake Erie 2014 algae bloom photos before Hook
- Have nutrient flow simulation loaded on student devices
- Key misconception to surface: "More nutrients = healthier ecosystem"

### Day 2: Stations 2-3
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5 min | Warm-up: Review eutrophication cascade |
| 15 min | Station 2: Dead Zone Data Analysis |
| 5 min | Transition |
| 20 min | Station 3: Design a Remediation Plan |

**Teacher Notes:**
- Distribute Gulf of Mexico data packets before Station 2
- For Station 3, display intervention cost/effectiveness table
- Circulate during engineering challenge to check budget math

### Day 3: Exit Ticket + Synthesis
| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 5 min | Warm-up: Connect eutrophication to Week 1 |
| 15 min | Exit Ticket: Biogeochemical Systems |
| 15 min | Whole-class synthesis discussion |
| 10 min | Preview Week 3 assessment |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How are ocean acidification and eutrophication similar?
2. Both are caused by humans adding chemicals to water. What's different about the chemicals?
3. How is eutrophication a positive feedback loop?

## Misconceptions to Target

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Targeted In |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| More nutrients are always better | Excess nutrients cause eutrophication | S1 Q4, Exit Q2 |
| Dead zones are permanent | Dead zones can recover with intervention | S3 design challenge |
| This only affects oceans | Freshwater ecosystems also affected | Hook, S2 |

## Spiral Reinforcement

### From Week 1 (Ocean Acidification)
- Exit Ticket SPIRAL Q1: Compare inputs (CO₂ vs. N/P)
- Discussion: Both are cascade processes triggered by human inputs

### From Cycle 3 (Feedback Loops)
- Station 1 Q5: Identify eutrophication as positive feedback

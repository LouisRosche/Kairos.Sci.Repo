# Grade 7 Cycle 4 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Ocean Acidification Investigation

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS3-3 (Primary), MS-ESS3-5 & MS-PS1-5 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Phenomenon

**The Dissolving Shells Mystery**
Scientists studying pteropods ("sea butterflies") discovered that shells collected today are thinner and more fragile than shells from 50 years ago. Some shells are literally dissolving while the animals are still alive. These tiny creatures haven't changed—the water has.

**Driving Question:** Why is the ocean dissolving shells now when it didn't 50 years ago?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain how atmospheric CO₂ affects ocean pH
2. Interpret pH data and predict effects on marine life
3. Apply mass balance to ocean-atmosphere carbon exchange
4. Design a monitoring system for ocean acidification

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What did we learn about CO₂ in Cycle 3?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Shell dissolution time-lapse video or images
- **Driving Question:** Why are shells dissolving now but not 50 years ago?
- **Cycle 3 Connection:** What gas is increasing in the atmosphere?
- **Materials:** Video/images of pteropod shell damage
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on CO₂ → carbonic acid (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Ask students to predict BEFORE showing explanation
- Connect explicitly to greenhouse effect from Cycle 3
- "We learned CO₂ traps heat. What else might it do?"

### Station 1: pH and Marine Life (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Interpreting pH data and predicting biological impacts
- **Activity:** Analyze historical ocean pH data table + organism thresholds
- **Key Vocabulary:** pH scale, logarithmic, acidification, carbonic acid, calcifying organisms
- **Spiral Connection:** Carbon cycle from Cycle 3

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- Data tables (embedded in student page)

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "0.1 pH is a tiny change" | Logarithmic: 0.1 = 26% more acidic | Emphasize scale math |
| "Ocean will become like battery acid" | Still basic (>7) even at 7.95 | Show pH scale visual |
| "Marine life will adapt" | Many can't adapt fast enough | Show threshold data |

**Tiered Support:**
- **Tier 1:** Sentence starters in form, word bank in HTML
- **Tier 2:** Pre-highlighted data table, worked example
- **Tier 3:** One-on-one pH concept review, reduced question load

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Ocean acidification mechanism
- **Model:** CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃ → H⁺ + HCO₃⁻
- **Think-Aloud:** Walk through the chemical reaction step-by-step
- **Visual:** Draw ocean-atmosphere CO₂ exchange diagram

**Key Points to Model:**
1. CO₂ dissolves in seawater (physical process)
2. Forms carbonic acid (chemical reaction)
3. Releases hydrogen ions (lowers pH)
4. H⁺ ions interfere with shell formation

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Research specific organism impacts (coral bleaching connection)
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap activity on carbon sinks

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What happens when CO₂ dissolves in seawater?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Carbon Sources and Sinks (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Mass balance calculations in ocean-atmosphere system
- **Activity:** Analyze global carbon budget, calculate ocean absorption
- **Spiral Connection:** Conservation of mass (Cycle 2, MS-PS1-5)

**Data Reference:**
- Sources: 40 billion tons CO₂/year
- Land sink: 12 billion tons (30%)
- Atmosphere: 18 billion tons (45%)
- Ocean sink: 10 billion tons (25%)

**Key Calculation:** 40 - 12 - 18 = 10 billion tons ocean absorption

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Is ocean CO₂ absorption good or bad? (Both—climate benefit, acidification cost)
2. What happens if the ocean becomes saturated?
3. Can carbon be "destroyed"? (No—conservation of mass)

### Station 3: Design a Monitoring System (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Engineering design for MS-ESS3-3
- **Activity:** Design ocean acidification monitoring network within constraints
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations) + Engineering Design

**Design Constraints:**
- Budget: $500,000 annual operating cost
- Coverage: At least 3 ocean regions
- Data: pH, temperature, CO₂ levels
- Frequency: Weekly minimum

**Available Technologies:**
| Option | Cost/year | Measures | Trade-offs |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Fixed Buoys | $50k each | pH, temp, CO₂ | Reliable but fixed |
| Argo Floats | $30k each | pH, temp | Mobile, no CO₂ |
| Ship Surveys | $200k each | All + samples | Complete but infrequent |
| Satellite | $100k | Surface only | Global but indirect |

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to check budget calculations
- Prompt students to justify trade-offs
- Ask: "How would policymakers USE this data?"

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (ocean acidification mechanism)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 3: carbon cycle, greenhouse effect)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (atmospheric + ocean CO₂ effects)
  - 1 SEP-6 question (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Can students explain the complete acidification mechanism?
- Can they connect atmospheric and oceanic CO₂ effects?
- Can they construct evidence-based arguments?

|-----------------|---------------------|
| CO₂ greenhouse effect | CO₂ dissolution in ocean |
| Carbon cycle | Carbon budget calculations |
| Molecular vibration | Chemical reaction (carbonic acid) |
| Conservation of mass | Mass balance in carbon budget |

**Explicit Connection Script:**
"In Cycle 3, we learned that CO₂ in the atmosphere traps heat. But CO₂ doesn't just stay in the atmosphere—about 25% gets absorbed by the ocean. Today we'll discover what happens when all that CO₂ dissolves in seawater."

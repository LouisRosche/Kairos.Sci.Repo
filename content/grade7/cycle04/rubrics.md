## Week 1 Rubrics: Ocean Acidification

### Station 1: pH Interpretation
**SEP:** Analyzing Data | **DCI:** ESS3.C | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** Ocean pH dropped from 8.2 to 8.1 over 50 years. A student says "That's only 0.1—it's basically nothing." Evaluate this claim.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Refutes + explains logarithmic scale + connects to biological impact | "This claim is incorrect because pH is logarithmic—a 0.1 drop means the ocean is 26% MORE acidic. This small-sounding change crosses thresholds for shell-forming organisms like pteropods and corals, which can't form shells below pH 8.0." |
| **3** | Refutes + mentions logarithmic OR explains biological impact | "The claim is wrong because pH is logarithmic, so 0.1 is actually a big change. It's 26% more acidic." |
| **2** | Refutes but explanation incomplete | "0.1 is actually a significant change for marine life." |
| **1** | Incorrect or partially correct with errors | "The student is right—0.1 is a tiny change that doesn't matter." |
| **0** | No response or irrelevant | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 pattern: "0.1 is small" → Student doesn't understand logarithmic scales
- Score 2 pattern: Correct intuition but can't articulate mechanism → Provide pH scale visual

### Station 2: Carbon Budget Calculation

**Question:** If 40 billion tons of CO₂ are emitted annually, 12 billion absorbed by land, and 18 billion stay in atmosphere, how much does the ocean absorb?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct (10 billion) + work shown + conservation statement | "40 - 12 - 18 = 10 billion tons. The ocean absorbs 10 billion tons per year. This accounts for all CO₂—none is created or destroyed." |
| **3** | Correct with partial work OR minor rounding | "10 billion tons" with some work shown |
| **2** | Correct setup but arithmetic error | "40 - 12 - 18 = 8 billion tons" |
| **1** | Incorrect setup or major error | "40 + 12 + 18 = 70 billion tons" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Adding instead of subtracting → Review conservation/mass balance
- Forgetting to account for atmosphere → Emphasize all carbon must be accounted for

### Station 2: Conservation of Mass Check
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** A student says "The CO₂ that dissolves in the ocean is destroyed." Is this correct?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Refutes + invokes conservation + explains transformation | "Incorrect—atoms aren't destroyed. The CO₂ molecules still exist as carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) in the water. The carbon and oxygen atoms are conserved; they just changed form from a gas to dissolved acid." |
| **3** | Refutes + mentions conservation OR transformation | "No, the CO₂ isn't destroyed. It changes into carbonic acid." |
| **2** | Refutes but explanation incomplete | "CO₂ can't be destroyed, it dissolves." |
| **1** | Incorrect or wrong reasoning | "Yes, dissolving means the CO₂ is gone." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP-6 + DCI ESS3.C/PS1.B + CCC Systems**

**Question:** A company claims their product "captures and destroys ocean carbon." Evaluate this claim.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Refutes destruction + explains capture possibility + system thinking | "The 'destroys' part is impossible—carbon can't be destroyed (conservation of mass). However, they could CAPTURE carbon and store it somewhere else, like underground or in solid form. This would remove it from the ocean system but not destroy the atoms." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Refutes destruction + partial capture explanation | "You can't destroy carbon atoms. Maybe they capture and store it somewhere." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Recognizes claim is problematic but weak explanation | "I don't think you can destroy carbon." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Accepts claim or major misconceptions | "If they have strong enough chemicals, they could destroy it." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Eutrophication & Dead Zones

### Station 1: Cascade Ordering

**Question:** Complete the eutrophication cascade: Fertilizer runoff → _____ → _____ → _____ → Dead Zone

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | All 3 steps correct + can explain causation | "Algae bloom → Algae die and sink → Bacteria decompose algae (use oxygen) → Dead zone. Each step causes the next—more nutrients = more algae = more decomposition = less oxygen." |
| **3** | All 3 steps correct OR 2 correct with explanation | "Algae bloom → Decomposition → Oxygen depletion" |
| **2** | 2 steps correct | "Algae bloom → Fish die → Dead zone" (missing decomposition step) |
| **1** | 1 step correct or logic reversed | "Fish die → Algae bloom → Pollution" |
| **0** | No response or all incorrect | Blank |

---

### Station 2: Data Interpretation

**Question:** The dead zone data shows it's largest in August. Explain why.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Connects seasons + farming cycle + lag time | "Farmers apply fertilizer in spring (March-May). Rain washes it to the Gulf. Algae bloom in warm summer months. By August, the algae have died and decomposed, using up oxygen. The ~3 month lag time makes August the peak." |
| **3** | Mentions farming + summer connection | "Fertilizer is applied in spring, and by August the algae have bloomed and died." |
| **2** | Partial explanation | "Summer is warmer, so algae grow more." (Missing farming connection) |
| **1** | Incorrect reasoning | "August is hot, so oxygen evaporates." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3: Engineering Design

**Question:** Design a remediation plan for a eutrophic lake with a $100,000 budget.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Within budget + addresses source + mechanism explained + trade-offs | "I'd spend $40k on cover crops for surrounding farms (prevents runoff), $30k on buffer strips of native plants (absorb nutrients), and $30k on aeration systems (adds oxygen). Trade-off: cover crops require farmer buy-in." |
| **4** | Within budget + addresses source + mostly explained | "Buffer strips ($50k) plus aeration ($50k). Buffer strips absorb nutrients before they reach the lake." |
| **3** | Within budget + partial mechanism | "$100k on aeration systems to add oxygen." (Doesn't address source) |
| **2** | Budget error OR missing mechanism | "$150k on algae harvesting" (over budget) |
| **1** | Major issues with design | "Drain the lake and refill it." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D)
**SEP-6 + DCI ESS3.C + CCC Stability and Change**

**Question:** Compare ocean acidification and eutrophication. How are they similar? Different?

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | 2+ similarities + 2+ differences + system thinking | "Similar: Both caused by human inputs, both cascade processes, both affect marine life. Different: OA from CO₂ (affects pH), eutrophication from N/P (affects oxygen). OA is global, eutrophication is local. Both show how human activities disrupt natural systems." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | 2 similarities + 1 difference OR vice versa | "Both are caused by humans. Acidification is from CO₂, eutrophication is from fertilizer." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | 1 similarity + 1 difference | "Both are bad for fish. One is about acid, one is about oxygen." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Only similarities OR only differences | "They're both pollution." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 3 Rubrics: Synthesis & Assessment

### Part 1: Synthesis Connection

**Question:** Explain how Week 1 (ocean acidification) and Week 2 (eutrophication) connect to Cycle 3 (carbon cycle/feedback loops).

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Both weeks connected + Cycle 3 integration + feedback concept | "Ocean acidification connects to Cycle 3 because CO₂ from the greenhouse effect also dissolves in oceans. Eutrophication is a positive feedback loop like ice-albedo: more nutrients → more algae → more decomposition → less oxygen → more nutrient release from dead organisms. Both show how carbon cycle disruption affects ecosystems." |
| **4** | Both weeks + Cycle 3, minor gaps | "Both connect to the carbon cycle we learned. Eutrophication is a feedback loop." |
| **3** | One week + Cycle 3 connection | "Ocean acidification connects to CO₂ from Cycle 3." |
| **2** | Recognizes connections but incomplete | "They're all about pollution and the environment." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "They're not connected." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 2: Cumulative - Engineering Claim Evaluation

**Question:** Evaluate: "We should pump oxygen into dead zones to fix them."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Addresses symptom vs source + feasibility + alternatives | "This treats the symptom (low oxygen) but not the source (nutrient runoff). You'd have to pump forever since nutrients keep coming. Better to reduce runoff with buffer strips and fertilizer management. Aeration could be part of a solution, but not the whole answer." |
| **4** | Addresses symptom vs source + one additional consideration | "This only treats the symptom. You need to stop the nutrients first." |
| **3** | Correct evaluation but incomplete reasoning | "It might help but it's expensive and doesn't stop the problem." |
| **2** | Partially correct | "Yes, more oxygen would help the fish." |
| **1** | Incorrect evaluation | "This is the best solution." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Part 3: Misconception Check

**Question:** Select TRUE or FALSE and explain: "Matter cycles but energy flows."

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | TRUE + explains both components + gives examples | "TRUE. Matter (like carbon, nitrogen) cycles through systems—CO₂ from air to ocean to organisms and back. Energy flows ONE direction—sun to producers to consumers, lost as heat at each step. Energy can't be recycled because of thermodynamics." |
| **3** | TRUE + explains one component well | "TRUE. Matter like carbon gets recycled, but energy is lost as heat." |
| **2** | TRUE + minimal explanation | "TRUE. Energy is used up." |
| **1** | FALSE or TRUE with wrong reasoning | "FALSE. Energy cycles too." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

## Quick Reference: Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Probing Question |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| "0.1 pH is tiny" | Logarithmic: 0.1 = 26% more acidic | "What does the pH scale actually measure?" |
| "More nutrients = healthier" | Excess causes eutrophication | "What happens when a system gets too much of something?" |
| "Dead zones are permanent" | Can recover with intervention | "What would need to change for oxygen to return?" |
| "Carbon is destroyed" | Matter is conserved | "Where do the atoms go?" |

# Grade 7 Cycle 7 Week 3 Lesson Plan
## Synthesis & Assessment

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS1-4 (Primary), MS-ESS2-2, MS-ESS2-5 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Focus
Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycles 5-6

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Connect rock cycle processes to geologic time evidence
2. Apply dating methods to novel scenarios
3. Demonstrate understanding of Earth's dynamic history
4. Integrate concepts from Cycles 5-7 in system-level explanations

---

## Day 1: Synthesis & Review

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check
- Overview of Week 3 assessment structure
- "Today we'll review and connect everything from Weeks 1-2"

### Part 1: Synthesis (20 pts | ~15 min)
- **Focus:** Connect W1 rock cycle + W2 geologic time
- **Format:** Short-answer and diagram-based questions

**Synthesis Questions:**
1. How does the rock cycle erase ancient sedimentary rocks?
2. Draw a timeline showing: ocean sediments → mountain fossil → discovery
3. Why are index fossils important for understanding Earth's history?

**Key Connections to Make:**
| Week 1 Concept | Week 2 Application | Integration |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Rock types | Dating rock layers | Age from rock type + fossils |
| Rock cycle | Why old rocks are rare | Recycling erases evidence |
| Metamorphism | Fossil preservation | Heat destroys fossils |

### Spiral Review Station (25 min)
- **Small groups rotate through review stations**
- Station A: Cycle 5 concepts (weather patterns, climate)
- Station B: Cycle 6 concepts (plate tectonics, seafloor spreading)
- Station C: Cycle 7 Week 1 (rock types, rock cycle)
- Station D: Cycle 7 Week 2 (stratigraphy, fossil evidence)

### Direct Instruction: Assessment Prep (10 min)
- Review assessment format and expectations
- Highlight common misconception traps
- Provide test-taking strategies for constructed explanations

---

## Day 2: Cumulative Assessment

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (60 pts | ~40 min)

**Section A: Rock Types & Cycle (15 pts)**
- Classify rocks from descriptions
- Trace pathways through rock cycle
- Connect rock type to formation environment

**Section B: Stratigraphy & Dating (15 pts)**
- Apply superposition principle
- Use index fossils to correlate layers
- Identify disturbance patterns (folding, intrusions)

**Section C: Fossil Evidence (15 pts)**
- Interpret fossil distributions
- Identify mass extinction evidence
- Connect fossils to environmental conditions

**Section D: System Explanations (15 pts)**
- Construct explanation for fossil on mountain
- Connect plate tectonics → rock cycle → fossil record
- Apply to novel scenario

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 pts | ~20 min)

**Target Misconceptions:**
| Misconception | Question Type | Correct Understanding |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Fossils are only bones | Multiple choice | Many types: trace, molds, casts |
| Rocks don't change | True/False with reasoning | Continuous rock cycle |
| Older = always deeper | Diagram analysis | Folding can reverse |
| Geologic time is short | Scale comparison | 4.5 billion years |

---

## Assessment Structure Summary

| Component | Points | Time | Focus |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min | Connect W1 + W2 |
| Part 2: Cumulative | 60 | ~40 min | All cycle content |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min | Persistent errors |
| **Total** | **100** | **~75 min** | |

---

## MTSS Considerations

### Tier 1 (Universal)
- Sentence starters for constructed explanations
- Rock cycle and time scale reference sheets
- Vocabulary word bank

### Tier 2 (Targeted)
- Extended time (up to 1.5x)
- Reduced question load
- Pre-labeled diagrams for reference

### Tier 3 (Intensive)
- Alternative assessment format
- One-on-one administration
- Modified rubrics focusing on core concepts

---

## Post-Assessment

### Data Analysis
- Track misconception persistence by question
- Compare to Cycle 5-6 performance
- Identify students needing Tier 2/3 support for Cycle 8

### Intervention Planning
- Schedule targeted reteach for persistent misconceptions
- Create peer tutoring pairs
- Prepare modified materials for Cycle 8

# Grade 7 Cycle 7 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Rock Types & the Rock Cycle

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS1-4 (Primary), MS-ESS2-2 & MS-ESS2-5 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Mountaintop Seashell Mystery**
Fossils of marine organisms—including trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoids—have been found near the summit of Mount Everest at 29,000 feet. These creatures lived in an ancient ocean over 450 million years ago. How did they end up on top of the world's tallest mountain?

**Driving Question:** How can you find seashells on top of a mountain?

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Classify rocks as igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic based on characteristics
2. Explain how rocks transform from one type to another
3. Connect the rock cycle to plate tectonic processes
4. Construct explanations for rock formation sequences

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What happens at convergent plate boundaries?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Fossil images from Himalayas + elevation data
- **Driving Question:** How did ocean creatures end up on mountains?
- **Cycle 6 Connection:** "We learned plates collide and form mountains. What happens to ocean floor when two continents collide?"
- **Materials:** Himalaya fossil photos (embedded)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on sedimentary rock formation (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Let students propose explanations before revealing the answer
- Connect explicitly to convergent boundaries from Cycle 6
- "These fossils were in sedimentary rock. What does that tell us about where the rock formed?"

### Station 1: Rock Classification Lab (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Classify rocks, identify formation processes
- **Activity:** Analyze rock sample images using classification key
- **Key Vocabulary:** Igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, texture, mineral composition
- **Spiral Connection:** Plate tectonics and where rocks form

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- High-resolution rock images (embedded)
- Classification flowchart (embedded)

**Rock Types Quick Reference:**
| Type | Formation | Characteristics | Examples |
|------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Igneous | Cooling magma/lava | Crystalline, no layers | Granite, basalt |
| Sedimentary | Compressed sediments | Layers, often fossils | Sandstone, limestone |
| Metamorphic | Heat + pressure | Banded, foliated | Marble, slate |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Fossils are only bones" | Trace fossils, molds, casts, preserved plants | Show variety of fossil types |
| "Rocks are permanent" | Rocks continuously cycle over millions of years | Connect to Cycle 6 recycling |
| "All igneous rocks look the same" | Intrusive (granite) vs extrusive (basalt) differ | Compare crystal sizes |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** The three rock types and their formation
- **Model:** Draw formation conditions for each type
- **Think-Aloud:** How does the same material become different rocks?
- **Visual:** Formation environment diagrams

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Igneous: Magma cools (slow = large crystals; fast = small crystals)
2. Sedimentary: Weathering → transport → deposition → compression
3. Metamorphic: Existing rock + heat/pressure = new rock
4. Location matters: Volcanoes, ocean floor, deep in crust

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Research specific rock formations in your state
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on Earth materials

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What are the three rock types and how do they form?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Rock Cycle Modeling (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Model transformations between rock types
- **Activity:** Trace rock pathways through the cycle
- **Spiral Connection:** Plate tectonics and the energy that drives change

**Rock Cycle Pathways:**
- Igneous → weathering → sedimentary → heat/pressure → metamorphic → melting → igneous
- Many pathways possible (not one direction)
- Energy sources: Sun (weathering), Earth's interior (heat)

**Key Questions:**
1. What makes a rock "cycle" instead of a one-way process?
2. Why don't we find 4.5 billion year old sedimentary rocks?
3. Where does the energy come from to drive the rock cycle?

### Station 3: Design a Rock Formation Timeline (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply cycle understanding to create explanations
- **Activity:** Construct timeline for a specific rock's journey
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations)

**Scenario:**
You find a sample of marble on a mountainside. The marble contains fossils of ancient sea creatures. Construct a timeline explaining how this rock formed and ended up where you found it.

**Timeline Must Include:**
1. Original organism environment
2. Sedimentary rock formation
3. Transformation to metamorphic
4. Current location explanation

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to ensure students include all steps
- Ask: "What evidence would support each step?"
- Connect to Cycle 6 plate movements

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (rock types and rock cycle)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 6: plate tectonics processes)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect plate tectonics to rock cycle)
  - 1 SEP-6 question (Construct explanation for rock formation)

## Week 1 Rubrics: Rock Types & the Rock Cycle

### Station 1: Rock Classification
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** ESS2.A | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** A rock sample has visible crystals, no layers, and contains quartz and feldspar. Classify this rock and explain its formation.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct classification (igneous) + explains formation + crystal analysis | "This is an intrusive igneous rock, probably granite. The visible crystals mean it cooled slowly underground, giving crystals time to grow. Quartz and feldspar are common in granite that forms from felsic magma deep in the crust." |
| **3** | Correct classification + formation OR crystal analysis | "Igneous rock because of the crystals. It cooled from magma." |
| **2** | Correct classification + minimal explanation | "Igneous rock. Crystals mean it's not sedimentary." |
| **1** | Wrong classification or major errors | "Metamorphic because of the crystals." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Rock Cycle Pathways
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** ESS2.A | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** Trace the pathway: Sandstone → [?] → Slate. What processes are involved?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct pathway + all processes + energy source | "Sandstone (sedimentary) → heat and pressure at convergent boundary → quartzite (metamorphic) → more heat/pressure → slate (metamorphic). Energy comes from plate collisions and Earth's internal heat. The original sediments get compressed and their minerals realign." |
| **3** | Correct pathway + major processes | "Sandstone becomes quartzite from heat and pressure, then more pressure makes slate." |
| **2** | Correct pathway + partial processes | "Heat and pressure change sedimentary to metamorphic." |
| **1** | Incorrect pathway or major errors | "Sandstone melts into slate." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Timeline Construction
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** ESS1.C | **CCC:** Scale, Proportion, and Quantity

**Question:** Construct a timeline for marble containing sea creature fossils found on a mountain.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | All 4 stages + timeframes + plate tectonics connection | "1) ~400 Ma: Sea creatures lived and died on ocean floor. 2) Shells accumulated as sediment → limestone formed. 3) ~50 Ma: Continents collided, limestone buried deep, heat/pressure → marble. 4) Mountain building pushed marble to surface. Timeline: 400 Ma → 50 Ma → today." |
| **4** | All 4 stages + timeframes | "Ocean animals → limestone → mountain building → marble → surface." |
| **3** | 3-4 stages + partial explanation | "Animals died, made limestone, turned to marble from heat." |
| **2** | 2-3 stages | "Sea creatures became fossils in rock." |
| **1** | 1-2 stages or major errors | "Fossils fell off the mountain." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Geologic Time & Fossil Evidence

### Station 1: Stratigraphy
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** ESS1.C | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** A core sample shows Layer A (bottom), Layer B, Layer C (top). Layer B contains trilobite fossils. What can you determine about the ages?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Applies superposition + uses index fossil + relative ages | "By superposition, A is oldest, C is youngest. Trilobites in B lived from 521-252 million years ago (Paleozoic Era). So B is from that time range. A is older than Paleozoic, C is younger (maybe Mesozoic or Cenozoic)." |
| **3** | Applies superposition + partial index fossil use | "A is oldest, C is youngest. Trilobites help date Layer B to the Paleozoic." |
| **2** | Applies superposition only | "A is oldest because it's on the bottom. C is youngest." |
| **1** | Major errors in principle application | "C is oldest because it's been there longest." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Fossil Distribution
**SEP:** Engaging in Argument from Evidence | **DCI:** ESS1.C | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** The same fossil species is found in both South America and Africa. These organisms couldn't swim across oceans. What does this evidence support?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Continental drift + multiple evidence lines + testable prediction | "This supports continental drift—the continents were once connected (Pangaea). If true, we should also find matching rock types and other fossils on both continents. Scientists have confirmed this with multiple lines of evidence. Plate tectonics explains how they separated over ~200 million years." |
| **3** | Continental drift + explanation | "The continents were once together. The fossils couldn't cross the ocean, so the land must have been connected." |
| **2** | Continental drift + minimal explanation | "This shows the continents used to be connected." |
| **1** | Incorrect explanation | "The fossils floated across the ocean." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Investigation Design
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** ESS1.C | **CCC:** Scale

**Question:** Design an investigation to determine the age and history of an unknown rock formation with three layers.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Multiple methods + evidence types + validation | "1) Apply superposition to determine relative ages. 2) Look for fossils in each layer—use index fossils to correlate with known age ranges. 3) Identify rock types to understand formation environment (ocean vs land). 4) Look for cross-cutting relationships (intrusions, faults). 5) If available, use radiometric dating for absolute ages. 6) Compare to nearby formations to validate." |
| **4** | Multiple methods + evidence types | "Use superposition, look for index fossils, identify rock types." |
| **3** | 2-3 methods with reasoning | "Look for fossils and use superposition to find relative ages." |
| **2** | 1-2 methods | "Look at which layer is on top." |
| **1** | Unrealistic plan | "Dig down to see how old it is." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Week 3 Rubrics: Synthesis & Assessment

### Part 1: System Connection

**Question:** Explain how the rock cycle affects our ability to study early Earth history.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Recycling impact + evidence erasure + exceptions | "The rock cycle continuously recycles rocks—sedimentary rocks weather, metamorphic rocks melt, igneous rocks erode. This erases evidence of early Earth. Oldest known rocks are ~4 billion years old, but Earth is 4.5 billion years old. Exceptions: Some ancient zircon crystals survived in younger rocks, giving us clues to earliest conditions." |
| **4** | Recycling impact + evidence erasure | "The rock cycle destroys old rocks, so we don't have many from early Earth." |
| **3** | Recognizes limitation | "Old rocks get recycled so we can't study them." |
| **2** | Partial understanding | "The rock cycle changes rocks over time." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "We have rocks from when Earth formed." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 3: Misconception Check

**Question:** TRUE or FALSE: "Fossils are only the bones of ancient animals." Explain your answer.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + multiple fossil types + examples | "FALSE. Fossils include: (1) Body fossils: bones, shells, teeth. (2) Trace fossils: footprints, burrows, coprolites. (3) Molds and casts: impressions in rock. (4) Preserved organisms: insects in amber, frozen mammoths. Even plants can fossilize—petrified wood is a famous example." |
| **3** | FALSE + 2-3 fossil types | "FALSE. Fossils include bones, shells, footprints, and plant impressions." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal explanation | "FALSE. You can have plant fossils too." |
| **1** | TRUE or confused | "TRUE, fossils are bones that turned to rock." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Quick Reference: Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Probing Question |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| "Fossils are only bones" | Many types: trace, molds, casts | "What about footprints or shells?" |
| "Rocks don't change" | Continuous rock cycle | "Where does sand on a beach come from?" |
| "Older = always deeper" | Folding can reverse | "What if layers got flipped?" |
| "Geologic time is comprehensible" | 4.5 billion years is vast | "If Earth's history were a day, when would humans appear?" |

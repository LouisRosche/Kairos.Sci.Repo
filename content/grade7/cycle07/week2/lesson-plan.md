# Grade 7 Cycle 7 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Geologic Time & Fossil Evidence

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS1-4 (Primary), MS-ESS2-2 & MS-ESS2-5 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Phenomenon

**The Deep Time Mystery**
Earth is 4.5 billion years old. If all of Earth's history were compressed into a 24-hour day, humans would appear in the last second before midnight. The entire written history of civilization would be a fraction of a second.

**Driving Question:** How do we know what Earth looked like millions of years ago?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Use superposition and fossils to determine relative ages
2. Interpret the fossil record to identify major events in Earth's history
3. Explain how index fossils help correlate rock layers
4. Design investigations to determine geologic history

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What are the three rock types?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Geologic time scale + human history comparison
- **Driving Question:** How do we know what Earth looked like millions of years ago?
- **Week 1 Connection:** "We learned rocks contain fossils. What can those fossils tell us?"
- **Materials:** Time scale visualization (embedded)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on rock type from Week 1 (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Emphasize the vastness of geologic time
- Use familiar comparisons (football field, 24-hour clock)
- "Scientists can't travel back in time, so how do they figure this out?"

### Station 1: Stratigraphy Investigation (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Use superposition and fossils to date layers
- **Activity:** Analyze virtual sediment core with layered fossils
- **Key Vocabulary:** Stratigraphy, superposition, relative age, index fossil
- **Spiral Connection:** Rock formation from Week 1

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- Virtual core sample (embedded)
- Index fossil cards (embedded)

**Key Principles:**
| Principle | Definition | Application |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Superposition | Younger layers on top, older on bottom | Dating undisturbed sequences |
| Original horizontality | Layers form horizontally | Tilted layers = later disturbance |
| Cross-cutting | Intrusions are younger than layers they cut | Dating igneous intrusions |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Older rocks are always deeper" | Folding/faulting can reverse order | Show folded rock diagrams |
| "We can date rocks by looking at them" | Need fossils or radiometric dating | Explain relative vs absolute |
| "Fossils tell exact ages" | Index fossils give age ranges | Show index fossil time ranges |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Using the fossil record to understand Earth's history
- **Model:** Walk through dating a rock sequence using index fossils
- **Think-Aloud:** How do scientists correlate layers across continents?
- **Visual:** Global fossil correlation maps

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Index fossils: Widespread, short time range, easily identified
2. Correlation: Same fossils = same time period
3. Major events: Mass extinctions mark boundaries
4. Geologic time scale: Based on fossil changes

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Research a specific mass extinction event
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on deep time concepts

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "How do index fossils help us date rock layers?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Fossil Record Analysis (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Interpret fossil patterns, identify major events
- **Activity:** Analyze fossil distribution data across geologic time
- **Spiral Connection:** Plate tectonics and fossil distribution (Cycle 6)

**Major Events in Earth's History:**
| Event | Time | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| Cambrian Explosion | 540 Ma | Sudden appearance of complex life |
| Great Dying (Permian) | 252 Ma | 96% marine species extinct |
| K-Pg Extinction | 66 Ma | Dinosaurs extinct, mammals rise |
| Quaternary Ice Ages | 2.6 Ma - present | Climate oscillations |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why do mass extinctions matter for the geologic time scale?
2. How do we know about life before fossils formed?
3. What can the fossil record tell us about future change?

### Station 3: Design a Geologic Investigation (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply dating methods to unknown strata
- **Activity:** Design investigation to determine history of unknown formation
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations) + SEP-7 (Engaging in Argument)

**Scenario:**
You discover a new rock formation with three distinct layers. How would you determine: (1) the relative ages of the layers, (2) what environment each layer formed in, and (3) approximately when each layer formed?

**Investigation Plan Must Include:**
1. Methods for determining relative age
2. Evidence to look for (fossils, rock type, minerals)
3. Expected findings for each layer
4. How to validate conclusions

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to ensure plans are testable
- Ask: "What evidence would prove you wrong?"
- Connect to real geologist methods

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (stratigraphy and fossil evidence)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 6: plate tectonics; Week 1: rock types)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect fossils to rock cycle)
  - 1 SEP-6 question (Construct explanation for fossil distribution)

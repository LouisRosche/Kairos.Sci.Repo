## Week 1 Rubrics

### Station 1: Misconception Check
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** Student A says: "When CO₂ absorbs energy, it breaks the bonds." Student B says: "The bonds don't break, they just vibrate." Who is correct and why?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies Student B + explains using bond energy + connects to Cycle 2 | "Student B is correct. The bonds don't break because breaking bonds requires MORE energy than IR provides. From Cycle 2, we learned breaking bonds is endothermic. The IR just makes bonds vibrate faster." |
| **3** | Correctly identifies Student B + explains using bond energy OR vibration | "Student B is correct because breaking bonds takes a lot of energy. The IR just makes the molecule shake." |
| **2** | Correctly identifies Student B but explanation incomplete | "Student B is correct because CO₂ molecules vibrate when they absorb heat." |
| **1** | Incorrect identification OR correct with wrong reasoning | "Student A is correct because energy breaks things apart." |
| **0** | No response OR completely irrelevant | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 pattern: "Student A is correct because absorbing energy gives molecules enough energy to break" → Reveals bond energy misconception
- Score 2 pattern: Circular reasoning ("vibrates because it vibrates") → Needs deeper probing

### Station 2: Mass Tracking Calculation

**Question:** A tree absorbs 48 lbs of CO₂ per year. How many pounds of carbon is that? (CO₂ is 27% carbon by mass)

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct answer (12.9-13.1 lbs) + clear work | "48 × 0.27 = 12.96 lbs of carbon" |
| **3** | Correct answer with partial work OR minor rounding (12.5-13.5) | "About 13 lbs" with partial work |
| **2** | Correct setup but calculation error | "48 × 27 = 1296" (forgot percentage conversion) |
| **1** | Incorrect setup or major error | "48 - 27 = 21 lbs" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Multiplying by 27 instead of 0.27 → Review percentage conversion
- Subtracting instead of multiplying → Review "of" means multiply

### Station 2: Conservation Check
**SEP:** Engaging in Argument | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** A student says "When we burn fossil fuels, we're creating new carbon that goes into the atmosphere." Is this correct?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Refutes + invokes conservation of mass + explains carbon origin | "This is incorrect because of conservation of mass—atoms can't be created. The carbon was already in fossil fuels from ancient plants. Burning just releases it back to atmosphere as CO₂." |
| **3** | Refutes + mentions conservation OR explains origin | "No, we're not creating carbon. The carbon was already in the fossil fuel from millions of years ago." |
| **2** | Refutes but explanation incomplete | "No, we can't create atoms." |
| **1** | Incorrect or partially correct with errors | "Yes, burning creates new carbon because fire makes things." |
| **0** | No response or irrelevant | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP 7 + DCI PS1.B/ESS3.D + CCC Energy and Matter**

**Question:** A company claims their product "destroys carbon pollution." Evaluate this claim.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Refutes using conservation + explains what likely happens + demonstrates carbon cycle understanding | "This claim is scientifically impossible. Carbon can't be destroyed (conservation of mass). The product might convert carbon from one form to another (like capturing CO₂ and storing it), but the carbon atoms still exist." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Refutes using conservation + partial explanation | "They can't destroy carbon because atoms aren't destroyed in reactions. They probably just move or store it." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Recognizes claim is problematic but explanation weak | "I don't think you can destroy carbon pollution completely." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Accepts claim or major misconceptions | "It's probably true if they have the right chemicals." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1: "Strong chemicals can break down anything" → Mass destruction misconception; return to manipulatives
- Score 2: Correct intuition but can't articulate → Provide sentence frames
- Score 3: Conservation correct but doesn't track WHERE carbon goes → Use carbon cycle diagram

## Week 2 Rubrics

### Hook Q2: Prediction - Ice Exposes Ocean (3 pts)
**Question:** When ice melts, it exposes dark ocean water underneath. How might this affect the temperature of the area?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Connects color to absorption/reflection with temperature consequence | "Dark water absorbs more sunlight (low albedo) so the area will warm up. Ice reflects sunlight, so losing ice means more heat absorbed." |
| **2** | Mentions color difference with partial explanation | "Dark water absorbs more light and gets hotter than ice." |
| **1** | Vague response | "It gets warmer because the ocean is warmer." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

**Question:** How does the greenhouse effect (CO₂ trapping heat) connect to this ice-melting feedback loop?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Correctly connects CO₂/greenhouse as initiating cause | "The greenhouse effect causes initial warming which melts ice. This exposes dark ocean, absorbing more heat, which melts more ice. Greenhouse effect starts it, ice-albedo amplifies it." |
| **2** | Mentions Week 1 concepts but unclear connection | "CO₂ traps heat which makes ice melt. Then more heat gets absorbed." |
| **1** | Vague connection | "They both involve heat." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

**Question:** Using the concept of ALBEDO, explain WHY some surfaces heated more than others.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Explains dark absorbs + light reflects using albedo correctly | "Black has LOW albedo—absorbs most light energy, converts to heat, molecules vibrate faster. Foil has HIGH albedo—reflects light back, never heats up." |
| **4** | Correct explanation missing one element | Missing molecular connection OR one surface |
| **3** | Partially correct | "Dark absorbs, light reflects" but no albedo term |
| **2** | Vague explanation | "Some got hot, some didn't" |
| **1** | Incorrect | "Black is a hotter color" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Full feedback loop + labels as positive feedback | "Ocean absorbs more → temp rises → more ice melts → more ocean exposed → [cycle continues]. POSITIVE feedback—amplifies itself." |
| **2** | Partial feedback loop | "Ocean absorbs more → warmer → more ice melts. It's positive feedback." |

| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 2 Q4: Identify the Feedback (4 pts)
**Question:** Complete: More CO₂ → Warmer climate → Ocean absorbs LESS CO₂ → ??? Is this positive or negative feedback?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Positive feedback with complete chain | "→ MORE CO₂ stays in atmosphere → even warmer. POSITIVE feedback—amplifying, not 'good'. System pushes further in same direction." |
| **3** | Identifies positive with partial chain | "More CO₂ stays → warmer → absorbs even less. Positive feedback." |
| **2** | Identifies feedback but wrong type | "Negative feedback because CO₂ is bad." |
| **1** | No feedback concept | Just repeats question |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**RED FLAG:** "Negative because CO₂ is bad" = confusing positive/negative with good/bad

---

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Predicts acceleration with feedback reasoning | "ACCELERATE because of positive feedback. Ice-albedo: more melting → more absorption → more melting. Each cycle stronger than last." |
| **3** | Correct prediction with partial reasoning | "Will accelerate because feedbacks amplify the change." |
| **2** | Prediction without feedback reasoning | "Will speed up" with no explanation |
| **1** | Incorrect prediction | "Will stay constant because CO₂ emissions are steady." |

| **5** | Correct calculation with clear work and units | "20 trees × 48 lbs = 960 lbs CO₂/year. Context: 1 person = ~36,000 lbs/year, so this offsets ~2.7% of one person." |
| **4** | Correct answer with partial work shown | "20 × 48 = 960 lbs of CO₂ per year." |
| **3** | Setup correct but calculation error | "20 × 48 = 860 lbs" |
| **2** | Attempted calculation | Numbers present but setup wrong |
| **1** | No calculation attempted | "Lots of CO₂." |

| **4** | 1 element well | Only explains HOW or only WHERE |
| **2** | General explanation | "Trees absorb carbon and store it." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

| **3** | Identifies 2+ limitations | "Limited space, trees could die or burn." |
| **2** | Identifies 1 limitation | "We don't have much space." |
| **1** | Vague limitation | "There are some problems." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

---

### Station 3 Q5: Feedback Connection (3 pts)
**Question:** How does your carbon capture relate to feedback loops? Could it break a positive feedback or create a negative feedback?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **3** | Correctly identifies how design relates to feedback loops | "Creates NEGATIVE feedback: More CO₂ → trees absorb more → less CO₂ → less warming. Change triggers response that REDUCES original change. Only slows positive feedbacks, doesn't stop them." |
| **2** | Partial connection | "Trees absorb CO₂ which would reduce warming—opposite of positive feedback." |
| **1** | No feedback concept | "It helps with climate change." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

| **4** | Definition + ice/ocean example + temperature consequence | "Albedo = fraction of light reflected. Ice has HIGH albedo (~0.8), reflects sunlight, stays cool. Ocean has LOW albedo (~0.06), absorbs sunlight, warms. More ice → more reflection → cooler; more ocean → more absorption → warmer." |
| **3** | Correct definition with example | "Albedo measures reflection. Ice reflects, ocean absorbs." |
| **2** | Partial definition | "Albedo is about reflection" |
| **1** | Vague response | "Albedo is about light and temperature" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

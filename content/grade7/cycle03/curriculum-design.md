## Week 1: The Greenhouse Effect Mystery

**Phenomenon:** "Why does a car get hot inside but not outside?"

### NGSS Alignment

**Performance Expectation:** MS-ESS3-5
> Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past century.

**3D Integration:**
- **DCI:** ESS3.D (Human impacts on Earth systems)
- **SEP:** Asking Questions and Defining Problems
- **CCC:** Cause and Effect; Energy and Matter

### Learning Targets

By the end of Week 1, students will be able to:
1. Explain how greenhouse gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation at the molecular level
2. Trace carbon atoms through the carbon cycle using conservation of mass
3. Apply thermal energy concepts to design a heat-trapping system
4. Connect Cycle 2 bond energy concepts to atmospheric warming mechanisms

### Station 1: Molecular Vibration & Bond Energy (INTERLEAVED RETRIEVAL)

**Spiral Target:** Students MUST correctly apply bond energy concepts to explain IR absorption

**Resource:** [PhET "Molecules and Light"](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/molecules-and-light)

**Task:** Analyze PhET simulation showing CO₂ molecules absorbing infrared radiation
- WHY does CO₂ absorb IR but not N₂?
- Draw molecular model showing energy transfer
- **CRITICAL:** "When IR energy is absorbed, do the bonds in CO₂ break or just vibrate faster?"

**Misconception Trap:** Students who believe "breaking bonds releases energy" will incorrectly predict CO₂ breaks apart. The simulation shows molecules vibrating, NOT breaking—forcing conceptual revision.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Correctly identify that bonds ABSORB energy to vibrate
2. Explain that breaking would REQUIRE more energy than IR provides
3. Connect to Cycle 2: Endothermic processes absorb energy

---

### Station 2: Carbon Cycle Conservation (INTERLEAVED RETRIEVAL)

**Spiral Target:** Conservation of mass in Earth systems

**Task:** Trace carbon atoms through photosynthesis → respiration → combustion → atmosphere
- Use manipulatives to physically move "carbon atoms" through cycle
- Balance each transformation (atoms in = atoms out)
- Calculate: If 1 tree absorbs 48 lbs CO₂/year, how many carbon atoms is that?

**Misconception Trap:** Students who believe mass disappears will struggle to balance the cycle. Physical atom manipulatives make conservation visible.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Demonstrate conservation through all cycle steps
2. Connect to Cycle 2: Chemical reactions rearrange, don't destroy atoms
3. Quantify carbon storage in different reservoirs

---

### Station 3: Engineering Challenge—Design a Thermal Trap

**Spiral Target:** Apply thermal energy concepts to solve problems

**Task:** Design and model a structure that maximizes heat retention
- Given constraints: 3 materials, limited surface area
- Must explain WHY each material choice affects thermal energy flow
- **INTERLEAVED:** Connect to Cycle 2 energy concepts—which materials absorb more thermal energy? Which conduct heat faster?

**Success Criteria:**
1. Evidence-based material selection using thermal properties
2. Correct explanation of heat trapping mechanism (absorption, conduction, radiation)
3. Connection to molecular-level energy storage (particles moving faster = higher temperature)

## Week 2: Feedback Loops & Tipping Points

**Phenomenon:** "Why might melting ice cause MORE melting?"

### Station 1: Albedo Effect Investigation (Digital Simulation)

**Task:** Use the Ice-Albedo Feedback Simulator to explore albedo and its effects
- Analyze reference data showing how surfaces with different albedos heat up

- Identify patterns in absorption rates
- Calculate: At current absorption rates, when will ocean pH drop from 8.1 to 7.95?
- **INTERLEAVED:** Explain using conservation of mass—where is the carbon coming from?

**Resource:** [NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/carbontracker/)

### Station 3: Engineering Challenge—Optimize a Carbon Sink

**Task:** Design a system to maximize CO₂ capture
- Options: Algae tanks, tree planting, direct air capture

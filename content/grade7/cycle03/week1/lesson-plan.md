2. **Station 1 Page** - PhET link + Station 1 form
3. **Station 2 Page** - Materials list + Station 2 form
4. **Station 3 Page** - Design constraints + Station 3 form
5. **Exit Ticket Page** - Exit Ticket form only

**Assignment Settings:**
- Points: By form (total 100 for week)
- Submission: External tool (Google Forms LTI)
- Available: Dec 1 at 12:00am
- Due: Dec 19 at 11:59pm (forgiving policy)

### Digital Resources (100% Material-Free)

| Station | Materials | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Chromebooks with PhET | 1 per student |
| 1 | Molecular model diagram | Embedded in student page |
| 2 | Carbon atom tracking simulation | PhET or digital manipulative |
| 2 | Carbon cycle diagram | Embedded in student page |
| 2 | Calculator app | On Chromebooks |
| 3 | Material properties comparison | Embedded in Google Form |
| 3 | Thermal trap simulation | Virtual design challenge in form |
| All | Timer/stopwatch | On Chromebooks |

### Physical Materials
- [ ] Notecards (1 per student for exit ticket notes)

> **Note:** This lesson is designed for 100% material-free digital instruction. All manipulatives, posters, and lab materials have been replaced with digital simulations and embedded resources. Students complete thermal trap design virtually using the Google Form design interface.

## Daily Schedules

### Monday, December 1 (65 min) — Period 2 & 7

| Time | Activity | Teacher Actions |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Entry + Settle | Display hot car image; students open Chromebooks |
| 0:05-0:15 | Hook Form | Independent completion |
| 0:15-0:17 | Transition | Assign groups; distribute materials |
| 0:17-0:37 | Station 1 | Circulate; ask probing questions |
| 0:37-0:40 | Pomodoro Break | Movement; water |
| 0:40-0:60 | Station 2 | Watch for conservation misconceptions |
| 0:60-0:65 | Wrap + Preview | "Tomorrow: Engineering challenge" |

**Station 1 Probing Questions:**
- "What do you see happening to the CO₂ molecule?"
- "Is the molecule breaking apart or staying together?"
- "If breaking bonds released energy, what would you expect?"
- "How does this connect to endothermic/exothermic from Cycle 2?"

**Station 2 Probing Questions:**
- "Where did that carbon atom come from originally?"
- "Can you create new carbon atoms? Why or why not?"
- "How many carbon atoms went in? How many came out?"

---

### Wednesday, December 3 (45 min) — Period 2 & 7

| Time | Activity | Teacher Actions |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0:00-0:03 | Entry + Review | "What did CO₂ molecules do when absorbing IR?" |
| 0:03-0:08 | Station 3 Setup | Distribute materials; explain constraints |
| 0:08-0:38 | Station 3 | Push for molecular-level explanations |
| 0:38-0:43 | Share Out | 2-3 groups share; class votes best explanation |
| 0:43-0:45 | Preview | "Thursday: Exit ticket" |

**Station 3 Probing Questions:**
- "Why did you choose that material?"
- "What happens to the particles when it absorbs heat?"
- "Which material conducts heat fastest? Good or bad for trapping?"

### Thursday, December 4 (65 min) — Period 2 & 7

| Time | Activity | Teacher Actions |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0:00-0:05 | Entry | Display: "Today: Show what you learned" |

## Real-Time Monitoring

### Misconception Watch List

| Misconception | Student Says/Does | Intervention |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "CO₂ breaks when absorbing IR" | "The molecule splits apart" | Point to simulation; emphasize vibration |
| "Burning destroys carbon" | "The carbon disappears" | Use manipulatives to trace atoms |
| "Dark colors are hotter" | "Black is hot" | Connect to absorption, not inherent temp |

### End of Each Day

1. Open Google Forms response summary
2. Check completion rate (target: >80%)
3. Scan short answers for misconception patterns
4. Flag students with 0 submissions for follow-up

## Differentiation Quick-Reference

### More Support
- Pair with stronger partner
- Sentence frames: "The evidence shows ___ because ___"
- Allow verbal responses recorded on phone
- Extended time (async by cycle end)

### More Challenge
- "Explain to a 5th grader why CO₂ traps heat"
- Design additional thermal trap variations
- Calculate exact carbon quantities in different reservoirs

### ELL Students
- Vocabulary glossary: absorb, vibrate, conserve, cycle
- Partner with bilingual peer
- Accept diagrams for partial credit

## Answer Keys

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| CO₂ mass calculation | 48 lbs × 0.27 = 12.96 ≈ 13 lbs carbon |
| Photosynthesis atoms | Same on both sides (36 atoms) |
| Bond misconception | Student B correct - bonds vibrate, don't break |
| Exit Q4 (endo/exo) | Endothermic absorbs energy |
| Exit Q5 (mass) | c) Stays the same |

---

## Emergency Backup Plans

### If Chromebooks fail:
- Print Station 1 simulation screenshots
- Station 2 works without tech
- Station 3 works without tech
- Paper Exit Ticket in emergency folder

### If internet is down:
- PhET can run offline if pre-downloaded
- Have paper forms ready

### If time runs short:
- Priority: Hook + Station 1 + Exit Ticket
- Stations 2-3 can be completed async
- **Never skip Exit Ticket**

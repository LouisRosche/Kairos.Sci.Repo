## Answer Key Highlights

### Part 1
- **Q2:** Increased CO2 from human emissions (NOT ice melting or albedo change)
- **Q4:** Carbon from ancient plants via photosynthesis (conservation)

### Part 2
- **A1:** Vibrates faster (NOT breaks apart)
- **A3:** H2O has 3 atoms + bent shape (pattern recognition)
- **B1:** 24 × 0.27 = 6.48 lbs carbon
- **B2:** Released as CO2 (conservation)
- **C2:** Dark ocean exposed → More heat absorbed (positive feedback)

### Part 3
- **MC1a:** Breaking bonds REQUIRES energy (most missed question)
- **MC2a:** Escaped as gases (CO2, H2O) into the air

## Exemplar Responses

### Part 1 Q1 (Diagram explanation) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> My diagram shows 4 connected processes: PHOTOSYNTHESIS takes CO2 from air → plants store carbon. FOSSIL FUEL FORMATION shows plants buried for millions of years → become coal/oil. COMBUSTION releases stored carbon as CO2 back to air. GREENHOUSE EFFECT shows CO2 in atmosphere trapping heat. Arrows connect these in a cycle: CO2 → plants → fossil fuels → burning → CO2. The cycle shows conservation of carbon atoms - they change location but never disappear.

**Partial (3/5):**
> Shows 4 boxes with arrows but doesn't explain HOW they connect or the role of carbon atoms.

### Part 1 Q3 (Acceleration mechanism) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> Climate change is accelerating because of POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS. Here's how it works:
> 1. Temperature rises slightly from greenhouse gases
> 2. Ice melts, exposing dark ocean
> 3. Dark ocean absorbs MORE heat (lower albedo)
> 4. More heat = more ice melts
> 5. CYCLE REPEATS - each round makes it faster
>
> This is positive feedback because the OUTPUT (melting) increases the INPUT (warming). It's NOT "good" - positive means amplifying. The greenhouse effect PLUS feedback loops together make climate change accelerate faster than just CO2 alone would cause.

### Part 2 A1 (CO2 vibration) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> When infrared radiation from Earth's surface hits a CO2 molecule, the molecule ABSORBS the energy and VIBRATES faster. The bonds between carbon and oxygen atoms bend and stretch but do NOT break. The key is that CO2's bent shape allows it to vibrate at the same frequency as infrared light. This absorbed energy keeps the heat in the atmosphere instead of escaping to space.

**Common Error (2/5):**
> "CO2 breaks apart and releases heat" - WRONG! Breaking bonds REQUIRES energy, it doesn't release it. The molecule stays intact.

### Part 2 B1 (Carbon calculation) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> Carbon in 24 pounds of coal:
> 24 lbs × 0.27 = 6.48 lbs of carbon
>
> This carbon doesn't disappear when burned. By conservation of mass, all 6.48 pounds must go somewhere. It combines with oxygen to form CO2 gas, which escapes into the atmosphere. The mass seems to "vanish" but it's just in gas form now.

### Part 2 C2 (Positive feedback explanation) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> The ice-albedo feedback is POSITIVE because:
> 1. Ice is white (high albedo = 0.9) → reflects 90% of sunlight
> 2. When ice melts, dark ocean is exposed (low albedo = 0.06) → absorbs 94% of sunlight
> 3. More absorption = more warming = more melting
>
> "Positive" doesn't mean good - it means the effect AMPLIFIES itself. Each degree of warming causes more ice to melt, which causes more warming. This is why Arctic ice is disappearing faster than scientists originally predicted.

### Part 3 MC1a (Bond energy) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> BREAKING bonds REQUIRES energy input (endothermic). Think of it like pulling apart magnets - you have to put in effort/energy to separate them.
> FORMING bonds RELEASES energy (exothermic). When atoms bond together, they release energy because they're moving to a more stable state.
>
> In combustion: Energy is REQUIRED to break C-H bonds in fuel. Energy is RELEASED when CO2 and H2O bonds form. The reaction is exothermic overall because more energy is released forming products than required to break reactants.

### Part 3 MC2a (Conservation of mass) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> The "missing" mass didn't disappear - it became GASES (CO2 and H2O vapor).
> Before: Solid wood + O2 from air = X grams total
> After: Ash + CO2 gas + H2O gas = same X grams total
>
> The scale shows less mass because gases escaped into the air. If you burned wood in a sealed container and weighed the whole container, the mass would be EXACTLY the same before and after. Atoms don't vanish - they just change form.

## Misconception Remediation Scripts

### Bond Energy Misconception (Group A)

**Opening:** "Let me show you something. These two magnets are stuck together. What do I have to do to separate them? [Pull - requires effort/energy] So does separating things release or require energy?"

**Key Point:** "Breaking bonds is like pulling magnets apart - it REQUIRES energy. Forming bonds is like magnets snapping together - it RELEASES energy."

**Apply to Climate:** "When CO2 absorbs infrared, the bonds don't break. They vibrate faster - stretch and bend. The molecule stays intact. Breaking CO2 would actually require a LOT of energy."

### Conservation of Mass Misconception (Group B)

**Opening:** "If I burn this piece of paper, where does the mass go? [Students often say 'destroyed' or 'into heat']"

**Reveal:** "The mass becomes CO2 and H2O GASES. If we weighed the air in this room before and after, the total mass is the same. Atoms can't be created or destroyed - only rearranged."

**Connect to Carbon Cycle:** "This is why burning fossil fuels adds CO2 to the atmosphere. The carbon atoms were stored in coal for millions of years. Burning doesn't destroy them - it releases them as gas."

## Data Analysis Plan

### After Assessment
1. Export all responses to spreadsheet
2. Calculate question-level percentages
3. Flag any question with <60% correct
4. Identify students <70% total → intervention list

### Misconception Tracking
| Misconception | Threshold | Action if > Threshold |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Bond energy | >30% wrong | Cycle 4 re-teach |
| Mass disappears | >25% wrong | Cycle 4 re-teach |
| Positive = good | >20% wrong | Quick review |

### Report to Generate
- Class average by section (A, B, C, D)
- Learning target mastery rates
- Misconception persistence rates
- Comparison to W1 and W2 exit tickets

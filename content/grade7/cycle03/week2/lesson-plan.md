## Real-Time Monitoring

### Misconception Watch List

| Misconception | Student Says/Does | Intervention |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------|
| "Positive means good" | "Positive feedback is helpful" | Clarify: positive = amplifying, not good |
| "Dark colors ARE hotter" | "Black is hot by itself" | Dark colors ABSORB more, they're not inherently hot |
| "Carbon sinks last forever" | "Forests will always absorb" | Discuss saturation and forest fires |
| "Feedback loops are simple" | Single-step explanations | Push for complete cycles with arrows |

### End of Each Day

1. Open Google Forms response summary
2. Check completion rate (target: >80%)
3. Scan feedback loop models for completeness
4. Flag students confusing positive/negative feedback
5. Note students who didn't connect to Week 1 concepts

---

## Differentiation Quick-Reference

### More Support
- Provide feedback loop template (pre-drawn arrows)
- Sentence frames: "When ___ happens, it causes ___ because ___"
- Allow verbal explanations recorded on phone
- Partner with stronger peer for Station 2 calculations

### More Challenge
- "Create a NEGATIVE feedback loop for climate"
- "Calculate: How many trees to offset one person's carbon footprint?"
- "Research: What are tipping points? Name 3 climate tipping points."

### ELL Students
- Vocabulary glossary: albedo, feedback, sink, positive, negative
- Partner with bilingual peer
- Accept diagrams with labels for written explanations
- Provide carbon budget data in table format (already done)

## Answer Keys

### Station 1 Reference Data (Albedo Effects)
| Surface | Albedo | Start | End (3 min) | Change |
|---------|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Black surface (ocean) | ~0.06 | 22°C | 38°C | +16°C |
| Water | ~0.10 | 22°C | 31°C | +9°C |
| White surface (clouds) | ~0.70 | 22°C | 27°C | +5°C |
| Ice/Snow | ~0.85 | 22°C | 24°C | +2°C |

### Station 2 Calculations
- Carbon imbalance: 41 - 22 = **19 Gt/year** remaining in atmosphere
- Interpretation: CO₂ levels increase each year because sinks can't keep up

### Exit Ticket Key Answers
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Q1 Albedo | Fraction of light reflected; ice high, ocean low |
| Q2 Greenhouse (spiral) | CO₂ absorbs IR, vibrates, re-emits |
| Q3 Feedback type | Positive - amplifying |
| Q4 Conservation (spiral) | Carbon released as CO₂, not destroyed |
| Q5 Integration | Connect 3 feedbacks amplifying each other |
| Q6 Model | Complete loop with arrows showing cause → effect → cause |

## Exemplar Responses

### Station 1 Q3 (Explain albedo pattern) - 5 points

**Exemplar (5/5):**
> Dark surfaces like ocean water heated the most because they have LOW albedo (~0.06) - they absorb most of the light energy. When light energy is absorbed, it converts to thermal energy, making the molecules vibrate faster. Ice and snow heated the least because they have HIGH albedo (~0.85) - they reflect most of the light back, so the energy never enters the material. This explains why melting ice exposes dark ocean, which absorbs more heat and causes MORE melting.

**Partial (3/5):**
> Dark surfaces absorb light and get hot. Light surfaces like ice reflect light and stay cool.

### Station 2 Q4 (Identify feedback) - 4 points

**Exemplar (4/4):**
> This is POSITIVE feedback (amplifying). The chain: More CO₂ → warmer climate → ocean absorbs LESS CO₂ → even MORE CO₂ stays in atmosphere → even warmer climate. The change amplifies itself - warming causes more warming.

### Station 3 Q3 (Scientific justification) - 8 points

**Exemplar (8/8):**
> HOW: Trees capture CO₂ through photosynthesis. CO₂ + H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂. The carbon from CO₂ becomes part of glucose molecules, then gets converted to cellulose in wood.
>
> WHERE: The carbon goes into the tree's trunk, branches, and roots as cellulose (wood). Some also goes into the soil when leaves decompose.
>
> HOW LONG: Trees store carbon for decades to centuries - as long as the tree lives. If the tree burns or decomposes, the carbon returns to the atmosphere as CO₂.

### Exit Q6 (Feedback model) - 3 points

**Exemplar (3/3):**
```
Temperature rises → Ice melts → Dark ocean exposed → More light absorbed → Temperature rises even more
       ↑                                                                              ↓
       ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```
> This is positive feedback because the effect (rising temperature) loops back to amplify the original cause. Each cycle makes the next cycle stronger.

## Emergency Backup Plans

### If Chromebooks have issues:
- Have students pair up to share devices
- Use projector to display simulation for whole-class exploration
- Print albedo reference data tables as backup

### If internet is down:
- Print carbon budget data sheets
- Print albedo reference data table from student page
- Paper Exit Ticket in emergency folder
- Have pre-downloaded simulation files if available

### If time runs short:
- Priority: Hook + Station 1 + Exit Ticket
- Station 2 calculations can be simplified
- Station 3 can be completed async
- **Never skip Exit Ticket**

## End-of-Week Checklist

- [ ] Export all form responses to spreadsheets
- [ ] Run IMPORTRANGE formulas in hub
- [ ] Sync scores to Canvas gradebook
- [ ] Review Exit Ticket feedback loop models
- [ ] Identify students <50% completion → Monday follow-up
- [ ] Compare to Week 1 data: Are spiral questions improving?
- [ ] Note misconceptions for Week 3 synthesis
- [ ] Prep Week 3 assessment materials

## Week 1 → Week 2 Spiral Check

Students should show improvement on these spiraled concepts:

| Concept | Week 1 Source | Week 2 Check |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| CO₂ absorbs IR | S1 Q2 | Exit Q2 |
| Molecules vibrate (don't break) | S1 Q4 | S1 Q4 |
| Conservation of mass | S2 Q2, Q3 | S2 Q3, Exit Q4 |

If class average on spiral questions is <70%, plan reteach for Week 3.

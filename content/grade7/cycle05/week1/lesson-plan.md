# Grade 7 Cycle 5 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Weather Fronts & Air Mass Collisions

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-5 (Primary), MS-ESS3-5, MS-ESS3-3, MS-ESS2-6 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Sudden Storm Mystery**
On February 1, 2011, Chicago was experiencing a normal winter day—cold but calm. Within 6 hours, a massive blizzard struck, dumping 21.2 inches of snow and stranding thousands of cars on Lake Shore Drive. Yet cities just 50 miles away received far less snow. What caused such dramatic weather to appear so suddenly?

**Driving Question:** What happens when air masses collide, and how can we predict the weather changes they bring?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Identify characteristics of different air mass types (mT, cT, mP, cP)
2. Explain how frontal boundaries form where air masses meet
3. Interpret weather maps showing pressure systems and fronts
4. Predict weather changes based on approaching fronts

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What did we learn about CO₂ and ocean chemistry in Cycle 4?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** 2011 Groundhog Day Blizzard time-lapse or satellite imagery
- **Driving Question:** Why did the storm hit Chicago so hard but miss nearby cities?
- **Cycle 4 Connection:** Weather involves water cycle + atmosphere interactions
- **Materials:** Satellite imagery of storm development (embedded in student page)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on water cycle basics (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Ask students to predict BEFORE showing explanation
- Connect explicitly to water cycle and energy transfer from Cycle 4
- "We learned how the ocean absorbs CO₂. Now let's see how air and water interact to create weather."

### Station 1: Air Mass Properties (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Identifying and classifying air mass types
- **Activity:** Analyze air mass classification system + match properties to source regions
- **Key Vocabulary:** Air mass, maritime (m), continental (c), polar (P), tropical (T), mT, cT, mP, cP
- **Spiral Connection:** Evaporation/condensation from water cycle (Cycle 4)

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- Air mass classification table (embedded in student page)
- Source region map (embedded in student page)

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Cold fronts only happen in winter" | Fronts occur in all seasons | Show summer cold front examples |
| "Air masses don't move" | Air masses travel across continents | Animate jet stream movement |
| "All air is the same" | Air masses retain source properties | Compare humidity/temp data |

**Tiered Support:**
- **Tier 1:** Classification chart with visual icons, sentence starters
- **Tier 2:** Pre-labeled source region map, worked examples
- **Tier 3:** One-on-one air mass concept review, simplified classification

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Air mass formation and movement
- **Model:** How geographic features create distinct air masses
- **Think-Aloud:** Walk through mP (cold, dry) vs mT (warm, humid) formation
- **Visual:** Draw North American air mass source regions

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Air masses form over large uniform surfaces (oceans, continents)
2. They acquire temperature and humidity of source region
3. Maritime (m) = humid (over water), Continental (c) = dry (over land)
4. Polar (P) = cold (high latitudes), Tropical (T) = warm (low latitudes)

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Research specific historic storms caused by air mass collisions
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap activity comparing weather vs. climate

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What are the four main air mass types over North America?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives: fronts and pressure systems

### Station 2: Frontal Boundary Modeling (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Understanding what happens when air masses meet
- **Activity:** Analyze cross-section diagrams of cold, warm, stationary, and occluded fronts
- **Spiral Connection:** Energy transfer concepts from Cycle 3

**Front Types:**
| Front Type | Diagram | Weather | Duration |
|------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Cold Front | ▲▲▲ (blue) | Heavy rain, storms, then clearing | Hours |
| Warm Front | ●●● (red) | Gradual clouds, light rain | Days |
| Stationary | ▲●▲● | Prolonged clouds and rain | Days |
| Occluded | ▲● merged | Complex, lifting | Variable |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why does cold air "wedge" under warm air? (Density difference)
2. Why are cold fronts often more violent? (Steeper slope, faster movement)
3. What happens to the moisture in warm air when it's forced up? (Condensation → clouds → precipitation)

### Station 3: Pressure System Analysis (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Interpreting weather maps and predicting changes
- **Activity:** Analyze real NOAA weather maps, identify fronts and pressure systems
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-4 (Analyzing and Interpreting Data)

**Key Concepts:**
- Low pressure (L): Rising air → clouds, storms, counterclockwise winds
- High pressure (H): Sinking air → clear skies, clockwise winds
- Isobars: Lines connecting equal pressure points
- Closer isobars = stronger winds

**Weather Map Reading Steps:**
1. Find H and L pressure centers
2. Identify front positions (cold ▲, warm ●)
3. Note isobar spacing (wind strength)
4. Predict: What weather comes next for a given city?

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to check map interpretations
- Prompt students to justify predictions with evidence
- Ask: "If you were a TV meteorologist, how would you explain this?"

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (air mass classification, front identification)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 3-4: water cycle, human impacts)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect air mass properties to weather prediction)
  - 1 SEP-4 question (Analyze weather map data)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Can students classify air masses by source region?
- Can they predict weather changes from approaching fronts?
- Can they interpret symbols on a weather map?

## Cycle 4 → Cycle 5 Connections

| Cycle 4 Concept | Cycle 5 Application |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Water cycle (evaporation/condensation) | Maritime air masses gain moisture |
| Ocean-atmosphere interaction | Ocean temperature affects coastal air masses |
| Human impacts on systems | Climate change affecting storm patterns |
| Conservation of mass | Water vapor → precipitation (mass conserved) |

**Explicit Connection Script:**
"In Cycle 4, we learned how CO₂ cycles between the ocean and atmosphere. Water also cycles between these systems—and that water vapor is the key ingredient for weather. Today we'll discover how large bodies of air carry this moisture across continents and what happens when they collide."

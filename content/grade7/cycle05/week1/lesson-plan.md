# Grade 7 Cycle 5 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Air Masses & Storm Formation

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-5 (Primary), MS-ESS3-3 & MS-ESS3-5 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Phenomenon

**The Spinning Storm Mystery**
Hurricane Katrina spun counterclockwise for days over the Gulf of Mexico, while tornadoes in Kansas spin much faster but only for minutes. Meanwhile, the weather front that brought rain yesterday just moved straight across—no spinning at all.

**Driving Question:** Why do some storms spin while others don't?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Identify characteristics of different air mass types (mT, cT, mP, cP)
2. Explain how frontal boundaries form where air masses meet
3. Interpret weather maps showing pressure systems and fronts
4. Predict weather changes based on approaching fronts

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What did we learn about human impact on atmosphere in Cycle 4?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Satellite hurricane footage + tornado video comparison
- **Driving Question:** Why do some storms spin while others don't?
- **Cycle 4 Connection:** How does human activity affect the atmosphere that creates these storms?
- **Materials:** Video comparison embedded in student page
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on air density (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Ask students to predict BEFORE showing explanation
- Connect explicitly to atmospheric changes from Cycle 4
- "We learned humans are changing atmospheric CO₂. How does the atmosphere create weather?"

### Station 1: Air Mass Collision Lab (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Density-driven air movement, front formation
- **Activity:** Analyze convection tank demonstration data + temperature readings
- **Key Vocabulary:** Air mass, continental, maritime, polar, tropical, front, density
- **Spiral Connection:** Human impact on atmosphere from Cycle 4

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- Convection demonstration video (embedded in student page)
- Temperature data tables (embedded)

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Cold air rises" | Cold air sinks (denser); warm air rises (less dense) | Density demonstration |
| "Weather and climate are the same" | Weather is short-term conditions; climate is long-term patterns | Clear definitions |
| "Fronts only happen in winter" | Fronts can occur in any season | Show summer cold front examples |

**Tiered Support:**
- **Tier 1:** Sentence starters in form, word bank in HTML
- **Tier 2:** Pre-labeled diagrams, worked example
- **Tier 3:** One-on-one density concept review, reduced question load

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Air mass types and classification
- **Model:** Draw mT, cT, mP, cP on US map with source regions
- **Think-Aloud:** Walk through how air masses get their properties
- **Visual:** Cold front vs warm front cross-section diagram

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Air masses form over source regions (land vs water, polar vs tropical)
2. Properties depend on source: temperature + humidity
3. When different air masses meet, fronts form
4. Density differences drive the interaction (warm rises, cold sinks)

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Research specific storm types (hurricanes vs tornadoes)
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap activity on atmospheric processes

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What are the four main air mass types?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Pressure Systems Mapping (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** High/low pressure systems, wind direction patterns
- **Activity:** Analyze weather maps, draw isobars, identify pressure centers
- **Spiral Connection:** Climate factors from Cycle 3

**Data Reference:**
- High pressure: clockwise rotation (N. Hemisphere), fair weather
- Low pressure: counterclockwise rotation (N. Hemisphere), stormy weather
- Winds flow from high to low pressure

**Key Calculation:** Pressure gradient = pressure change / distance

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why does low pressure bring clouds and storms? (Rising air cools, condenses)
2. How do meteorologists use pressure readings? (Predict weather changes)
3. What happens when a high and low pressure system meet?

### Station 3: Design a Storm Warning System (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Engineering design for MS-ESS2-5
- **Activity:** Design early warning network within constraints
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-3 (Planning and Carrying Out Investigations) + Engineering Design

**Design Constraints:**
- Budget: $300,000 annual operating cost
- Coverage: At least 4 weather monitoring stations
- Data: Pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed
- Frequency: Hourly minimum

**Available Technologies:**
| Option | Cost/year | Measures | Trade-offs |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Weather Station | $25k each | Temp, pressure, humidity, wind | Reliable but fixed location |
| Doppler Radar | $150k | Precipitation, wind patterns | Excellent storm detection |
| Weather Balloons | $15k/year | Upper atmosphere data | Daily only, covers wide area |
| Satellite Feed | $50k | Cloud patterns, regional view | Not ground-level data |

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to check budget calculations
- Prompt students to justify trade-offs
- Ask: "How would emergency managers USE this data to save lives?"

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (air masses and fronts)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 3-4: climate change, human impact)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (atmospheric + weather patterns)
  - 1 SEP-3 question (Data collection planning)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Can students identify air mass types from source regions?
- Can they predict weather from approaching fronts?
- Can they explain the connection between density and air movement?

## Cycle 3-4 → Cycle 5 Connections

| Previous Cycle Concept | Cycle 5 Application |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| CO₂ greenhouse effect (C3) | Atmospheric heating drives air mass formation |
| Feedback loops (C3) | Weather systems as feedback processes |
| Ocean chemistry (C4) | Ocean temperature affects coastal weather |
| Human impact (C4) | Climate change affecting storm intensity |

**Explicit Connection Script:**
"In Cycles 3 and 4, we learned how CO₂ affects the atmosphere and oceans. Now we'll explore how the atmosphere creates weather—the short-term patterns we experience every day. Remember, weather is what's happening NOW; climate is the long-term average."

## Extension Activities

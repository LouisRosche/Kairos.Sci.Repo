## Overview

Assessment week synthesizing Weeks 1-2 content on weather fronts, air masses, and severe weather prediction. Students demonstrate understanding of how air mass interactions create weather changes and how data analysis enables forecasting.

### Assessment Structure

| Part 1 | Synthesis Review | 20 | ~15 min |
| Part 2 | Cumulative Assessment | 60 | ~40 min |
| Part 3 | Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min |

### Learning Targets Assessed
**From Week 1 (Weather Fronts & Air Mass Collisions):**
1. Identify characteristics of different air mass types (mT, cT, mP, cP)
2. Explain how frontal boundaries form where air masses meet
3. Interpret weather maps showing pressure systems and fronts
4. Predict weather changes based on approaching fronts

**From Week 2 (Severe Weather Prediction & Data Analysis):**
1. Collect and organize weather data from multiple sources
2. Identify patterns in temperature, pressure, and humidity data
3. Use data evidence to support weather predictions
4. Evaluate the reliability of weather forecasts

# Grade 7 Cycle 5 Week 3 Lesson Plan
## Synthesis & Assessment

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-5 (Primary), MS-ESS3-5, MS-ESS3-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Focus
Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycles 3-4

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Connect air mass interactions to weather prediction challenges
2. Apply weather/climate distinction to real-world scenarios
3. Demonstrate understanding of data collection and analysis
4. Integrate concepts from Cycles 3-5 in system-level explanations

---

## Day 1: Synthesis & Review

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check
- Overview of Week 3 assessment structure
- "Today we'll review and connect everything from Weeks 1-2"

### Part 1: Synthesis (20 pts | ~15 min)
- **Focus:** Connect W1 air masses + W2 prediction/climate
- **Format:** Short-answer and diagram-based questions

**Synthesis Questions:**
1. How do air mass characteristics affect prediction accuracy?
2. Draw a concept map connecting: Air masses → Fronts → Weather → Climate
3. Why is weather harder to predict than climate?

**Key Connections to Make:**
| Week 1 Concept | Week 2 Application | Integration |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Air mass types | Data collection variables | Which variables matter most? |
| Front formation | Prediction accuracy | Why fronts are unpredictable |
| Pressure systems | Climate patterns | Long-term pressure trends |

### Spiral Review Station (25 min)
- **Small groups rotate through review stations**
- Station A: Cycle 3 climate concepts (greenhouse effect, feedback loops)
- Station B: Cycle 4 human impact (ocean chemistry, biogeochemical cycles)
- Station C: Cycle 5 Week 1 (air masses, fronts)
- Station D: Cycle 5 Week 2 (prediction, climate vs weather)

**Materials per station:**
- Review cards with key concepts
- Practice problems
- Self-check answer sheets

### Direct Instruction: Assessment Prep (10 min)
- Review assessment format and expectations
- Highlight common misconception traps
- Provide test-taking strategies for constructed response

---

## Day 2: Cumulative Assessment

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (60 pts | ~40 min)

**Section A: Air Mass Interactions (15 pts)**
- Identify air mass types from source regions
- Predict weather from front approach
- Explain density-driven air movement

**Section B: Weather vs Climate (15 pts)**
- Distinguish weather events from climate trends
- Interpret temperature data (daily vs 30-year)
- Explain why one cold day doesn't disprove warming

**Section C: Data Analysis (15 pts)**
- Interpret weather maps with isobars
- Analyze precipitation and temperature data
- Calculate pressure gradients

**Section D: System Models (15 pts)**
- Draw and explain air mass interaction diagram
- Connect atmospheric processes to prediction challenges
- Apply system thinking to weather forecasting

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 pts | ~20 min)

**Target Misconceptions:**
| Misconception | Question Type | Correct Understanding |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Weather = Climate | Multiple choice with explain | Weather short-term, climate long-term |
| Cold air rises | True/False with reasoning | Cold air sinks (denser) |
| Seasons from distance | Diagram analysis | Axial tilt causes seasons |
| Predictions are guesses | Claim-Evidence-Reasoning | Based on scientific data and models |

**Format:**
- Each misconception has 5-point question
- Must identify whether statement is correct
- Must explain WHY with evidence from unit

## Assessment Structure Summary

| Component | Points | Time | Focus |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min | Connect W1 + W2 |
| Part 2: Cumulative | 60 | ~40 min | All cycle content |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min | Persistent errors |
| **Total** | **100** | **~75 min** | |

---

## MTSS Considerations

### Tier 1 (Universal)
- Sentence starters for all constructed response
- Word bank with cycle vocabulary
- Concept map templates

### Tier 2 (Targeted)
- Extended time (up to 1.5x)
- Reduced question load (prioritized items)
- Reference sheet with key formulas/concepts

### Tier 3 (Intensive)
- Alternative assessment format (oral responses)
- One-on-one administration option
- Modified rubrics focusing on core concepts

---

## Materials List

### Digital Resources
- [ ] Chromebooks (class set)
- [ ] Google Forms for assessment
- [ ] Review station materials (embedded)

### Physical Materials
- [ ] Notecards (for formula reference)
- [ ] Scratch paper for calculations
- [ ] Colored pencils for diagrams

---

## Grading Notes

### Constructed Response Rubric (General)
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Complete, accurate, well-reasoned with evidence |
| 4 | Mostly complete, minor errors or gaps |
| 3 | Partial understanding, some misconceptions |
| 2 | Limited understanding, significant gaps |
| 1 | Minimal relevant content |
| 0 | No response or completely incorrect |

### Priority Concepts
1. Air mass identification and front prediction
2. Weather vs climate distinction
3. Data interpretation and pattern recognition
4. System-level thinking about atmospheric processes

---

## Post-Assessment

### Data Analysis
- Track misconception persistence by question
- Compare to Cycle 3-4 performance
- Identify students needing Tier 2/3 support for Cycle 6

### Intervention Planning
- Schedule targeted reteach for persistent misconceptions
- Create peer tutoring pairs based on strength areas
- Prepare modified materials for Cycle 6 as needed

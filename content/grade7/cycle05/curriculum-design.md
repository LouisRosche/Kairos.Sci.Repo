## February 23 - March 12, 2026

## NGSS Alignment

### Primary Standard
**MS-ESS2-5:** Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses result in changes in weather conditions.

### Spiral Standards
| Standard | Description | From Cycle |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| MS-ESS3-5 | Climate change factors | Cycle 3 |
| MS-ESS3-3 | Human impact on environment | Cycle 4 |
| MS-ESS2-6 | Role of water cycle in weather | Cycle 4 |

### 3-Dimensional Learning
- **SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data (SEP-4), Developing and Using Models (SEP-2)
- **DCI:** ESS2.C The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes, ESS2.D Weather and Climate
- **CCC:** Patterns (CCC-1), Cause and Effect (CCC-2), Systems and System Models (CCC-4)

## Anchoring Phenomenon

**Why did the "Groundhog Day Blizzard" hit some cities harder than others?**

On February 1-2, 2011, a massive blizzard paralyzed Chicago with 21.2 inches of snow, stranding thousands on Lake Shore Drive. Yet cities just 50 miles away received far less snow. The storm formed when Arctic air collided with warm, moist Gulf air over the central US.

This connects to Cycles 3-4: The same atmospheric processes that drive climate patterns create weather events.

## Week-by-Week Structure

### Week 1: Weather Fronts & Air Mass Collisions
**Phenomenon:** What happens when air masses collide?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Sudden Storm Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Air Mass Properties | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Frontal Boundary Modeling | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Pressure System Analysis | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Air Mass Integration | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Identify the characteristics of different air mass types (mT, cT, mP, cP)
2. Explain how frontal boundaries form where air masses meet
3. Interpret weather maps showing pressure systems and fronts
4. Predict weather changes based on approaching fronts

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Cold fronts are always in winter" → Fronts can occur in any season
- "Low pressure means cold weather" → Low pressure means unstable air/storms
- "Air masses don't move" → Air masses travel across continents

### Week 2: Severe Weather Prediction & Data Analysis
**Phenomenon:** How do meteorologists predict severe weather?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The 48-Hour Forecast Challenge | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Weather Data Collection | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Pattern Recognition | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Build Your Own Forecast | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Prediction Synthesis | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Collect and organize weather data from multiple sources
2. Identify patterns in temperature, pressure, and humidity data
3. Use data evidence to support weather predictions
4. Evaluate the reliability of weather forecasts

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Weather predictions are just guesses" → Based on scientific data and models
- "Radar shows rain" → Radar shows precipitation and intensity
- "Climate and weather are the same" → Weather is short-term; climate is long-term pattern

### Week 3: Synthesis & Assessment
**Focus:** Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycles 3-4

| Component | Points | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Part 2: Cumulative Assessment | 60 | ~40 min |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min |

## Cycle 3-4 → Cycle 5 Connections

| Previous Cycle Concept | Cycle 5 Application |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| CO₂ and greenhouse effect (C3) | Atmospheric heating drives air mass formation |
| Feedback loops (C3) | Weather systems as feedback processes |
| Ocean chemistry (C4) | Ocean temperature affects coastal weather |
| Biogeochemical cycles (C4) | Water cycle powers weather systems |

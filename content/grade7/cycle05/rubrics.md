## Week 1 Rubrics: Air Masses & Storm Formation

### Station 1: Air Mass Identification
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** ESS2.D | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** An air mass forms over the Gulf of Mexico in summer. What type is it, and what weather might it bring to Texas?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct type (mT) + explains formation + predicts weather | "This is a maritime Tropical (mT) air mass because it forms over warm ocean water. It will be warm and humid. When it moves over Texas, it could bring thunderstorms because the moist air will rise and condense." |
| **3** | Correct type + one explanation OR prediction | "Maritime Tropical (mT) because it's over water in a warm area. It will bring humid weather." |
| **2** | Correct type but explanation incomplete | "It's mT. It will be humid." |
| **1** | Incorrect type or major misconception | "Continental Polar because the Gulf is cold." |
| **0** | No response or completely irrelevant | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 pattern: Confuses warm/cold or land/water → Review source region concept
- Score 2 pattern: Can classify but can't explain mechanism → Model formation process

### Station 2: Front Formation
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** ESS2.D | **CCC:** Systems and System Models

**Question:** Explain what happens when a cold air mass meets a warm air mass. Use the word "density" in your answer.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Uses density + explains wedging + predicts weather | "Cold air is denser than warm air, so when they meet, the cold air wedges under the warm air, pushing it up. The rising warm air cools and condenses, forming clouds and often precipitation at the front." |
| **3** | Uses density + partial mechanism | "Cold air is denser so it goes under warm air. This creates clouds." |
| **2** | Mentions density but mechanism unclear | "The denser cold air meets the warm air and makes weather." |
| **1** | Doesn't use density or major errors | "Cold fronts push warm fronts out of the way." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- "Cold air rises" → Density remediation with demonstration
- Confuses front types → Visual comparison of cold vs warm fronts

### Station 3: Engineering Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** ESS2.D | **CCC:** Systems and System Models

**Question:** Design a storm warning network for a coastal city with $300,000 budget. Justify your choices.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Within budget + justified choices + trade-offs + data use | "I'd use: 3 weather stations ($75k), 1 Doppler radar ($150k), satellite feed ($50k) = $275k. Radar is essential for storm tracking. Weather stations provide ground truth data. Satellite shows incoming systems. Trade-off: No weather balloons, so less upper atmosphere data." |
| **4** | Within budget + justified choices + mentions trade-offs | "Doppler radar plus 4 weather stations = $250k. The radar tracks storms, stations give local data." |
| **3** | Within budget + some justification | "$300k on 12 weather stations. More stations = more data." (Missing optimization) |
| **2** | Budget error OR missing justification | "$400k on radar and satellites." (Over budget) |
| **1** | Major design flaws | "One weather balloon is enough." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration
**SEP-3 + DCI ESS2.D + CCC-2**

**Question:** A farmer asks: "Should I trust a 7-day weather forecast?" Explain using what you learned about air masses and prediction.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Connects accuracy decay + air mass complexity + practical advice | "Trust it less as days increase. 1-2 day forecasts are ~95% accurate because we can track current air masses. By day 7, it's only ~80% because small changes in air mass paths compound over time. Check the forecast daily and have a backup plan for day 7." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Mentions accuracy + air mass connection | "It's less accurate by day 7. Air masses are hard to predict perfectly." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | General statement about accuracy | "Weather forecasts get less accurate over time." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Incorrect or dismissive | "Don't trust any forecast—they're just guessing." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Weather Prediction & Climate Patterns

### Station 1: Data Analysis
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** ESS2.D | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Examine the graph showing daily temperatures for March. The average is 55°F, but temperatures range from 35°F to 75°F. Is this normal? Explain.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Identifies variability as normal + explains weather vs climate + uses evidence | "Yes, this is normal for weather. The 40-degree range shows daily weather variability. The 55°F average represents the climate for March. Individual days fluctuate due to passing air masses and fronts, but the average stays consistent year to year." |
| **3** | Identifies as normal + partial explanation | "This is normal because weather changes day to day, but the average is about the same." |
| **2** | Correct answer but weak explanation | "Yes, it's normal. Weather varies." |
| **1** | Incorrect answer or major confusion | "No, this is too much variation. Something is wrong." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Climate vs Weather Distinction
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** ESS2.D | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** A politician says: "It snowed in April, so global warming is fake." Evaluate this claim using the weather/climate distinction.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Refutes + distinguishes weather/climate + provides counter-evidence | "This is flawed reasoning. Snow in April is weather—a single event. Global warming is about climate—30+ year average trends. Even with warming, cold weather events still occur. The evidence shows that despite occasional cold snaps, average global temperatures have risen 1°C over 100 years." |
| **3** | Refutes + distinguishes weather/climate | "The claim is wrong because one snow day is weather, not climate. Climate is the average over decades." |
| **2** | Refutes but explanation incomplete | "One day of snow doesn't prove anything about long-term climate." |
| **1** | Accepts claim or major misconceptions | "The politician has a point—if it's warming, why did it snow?" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Climate Monitoring Design
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** ESS2.D | **CCC:** Stability and Change

**Question:** You're designing a 30-year climate monitoring station. What are the THREE most important factors to consider? Explain each.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | 3 valid factors + explains each + considers longevity | "1) Location stability—can't be near future construction that changes local climate. 2) Sensor accuracy—need consistent measurements over 30 years. 3) Data redundancy—backup systems in case primary fails. Over 30 years, technology changes, so we need a system that can be maintained or upgraded." |
| **4** | 3 valid factors + mostly explained | "Location, accuracy, and backup systems are important. Location needs to stay the same for consistent data." |
| **3** | 2-3 factors with partial explanation | "Location and accuracy matter most." |
| **2** | 1-2 factors or weak explanations | "Accuracy is important." |
| **1** | Irrelevant factors | "Make it look nice and be easy to access." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Weather vs Climate Integration
**SEP-4 + DCI ESS2.D + CCC-1**

**Question:** Why is climate easier to predict than weather, even though weather predictions use more advanced technology?

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Explains chaos + averaging + pattern emergence | "Weather is chaotic—small changes compound quickly, making long-term predictions impossible. Climate is the average of weather over 30+ years. While individual days are unpredictable, the overall patterns (average temperatures, typical rainfall) are stable and predictable because the variations cancel out over time." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Mentions averaging + reduced variability | "Climate is easier because it's the average. Individual weather days are chaotic, but averages are stable." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | General statement without mechanism | "Climate is predictable because it's a pattern." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Incorrect reasoning | "Climate is easier because we have more data." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | All 5 elements + valid connections + Cycle 3-4 link + explanations | "Air masses → Fronts (when different air masses meet) → Weather (temperature, precipitation changes) → Prediction (uses data about air masses) → Climate (average of weather over 30 years). Connected to Cycle 3: CO₂ affects atmosphere → affects air mass formation → affects weather patterns." |
| **4** | All 5 elements + valid connections + Cycle link | All present with connection to prior cycle |
| **3** | 4-5 elements + mostly valid connections | Minor gaps in logic |
| **2** | 3-4 elements + some valid connections | Missing key relationships |

### Part 2: Cumulative - System Thinking

**Question:** Explain how understanding air masses helps both weather forecasters AND climate scientists. Include specific examples.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Both applications + specific examples + mechanism | "Weather forecasters track current air mass movements to predict tomorrow's weather—e.g., a cold front approaching means temperature drop. Climate scientists study air mass patterns over decades—e.g., if mT air masses from the Gulf are reaching farther north over time, that indicates warming trends." |
| **4** | Both applications + examples | Explains both uses with examples |
| **3** | Both applications, limited examples | "Forecasters use air masses for predictions. Climate scientists study patterns." |
| **2** | One application only | Only forecasters OR only climate scientists |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Air masses aren't important for prediction." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 3: Misconception Check

**Question:** TRUE or FALSE: "Cold air rises because it's heavier." Explain your answer.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + explains density correctly + gives example | "FALSE. Cold air SINKS because it's denser (molecules closer together). Warm air rises because it's less dense. This is why hot air balloons go up—the heated air inside is less dense than surrounding air. This density difference drives convection and front formation." |
| **3** | FALSE + explains density | "FALSE. Cold air is denser so it sinks. Warm air rises." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal explanation | "FALSE. Cold air sinks." |
| **1** | TRUE or confused reasoning | "TRUE. Heavy things go down, so cold heavy air falls... wait, rises?" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

## Quick Reference: Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Probing Question |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|
| "Cold air rises" | Cold air sinks (denser); warm air rises | "Which air is denser? What happens to denser things?" |
| "Weather = Climate" | Weather is short-term; climate is 30+ year average | "How long is 'weather' versus 'climate'?" |
| "Seasons from distance" | Axial tilt causes seasons | "Why is it winter in Australia when it's summer here?" |
| "Predictions are guesses" | Based on physics, data, and computer models | "How do meteorologists actually make forecasts?" |

# Grade 7 Cycle 5 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Severe Weather Prediction & Data Analysis

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-5 (Primary), MS-ESS3-5, MS-ESS2-6 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Phenomenon

**The 48-Hour Forecast Challenge**
On April 27, 2011, meteorologists predicted a major tornado outbreak 3 days in advance. The Storm Prediction Center issued warnings that saved thousands of lives. But sometimes forecasts fail—in 2012, Hurricane Sandy's unusual left turn surprised many models. How do meteorologists know what weather is coming, and why are some predictions more accurate than others?

**Driving Question:** How do meteorologists collect and analyze data to predict severe weather?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Collect and organize weather data from multiple sources
2. Identify patterns in temperature, pressure, and humidity data
3. Use data evidence to support weather predictions
4. Evaluate the reliability of weather forecasts

- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on air mass concepts (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show contrast: Joplin tornado (accurate prediction) vs. Sandy's turn (surprise)
- Ask: "What data would you need to predict weather?"
- Connect to Week 1: "How would knowing about air masses help?"

### Station 1: Weather Data Collection (18 min | 20 pts)

| Satellite | Cloud cover, storm tracking | Images |
| Weather balloons | Upper atmosphere conditions | Profiles |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Predictions are just guesses" | Based on scientific data and models | Show data inputs for forecasts |
| "More data = always better" | Quality and relevance matter | Discuss data overload |
| "Weather and climate are the same" | Weather = short-term, Climate = long-term patterns | Explicit comparison |

**Tiered Support:**

- **Think-Aloud:** "If I see falling pressure and rising humidity, what do I predict?"
- **Visual:** Show NOAA forecast discussion example

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Collect data from multiple sources (surface, air, satellite)
2. Look for PATTERNS across space and time
3. Compare to historical events (pattern matching)
4. Account for UNCERTAINTY in predictions

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete data collection stations
- **Extension:** Explore NWS forecast discussions online
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 compare weather vs. climate data analysis

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What are the four main types of weather data we collect?"
- Review Week 1: "How do fronts affect weather predictions?"
- Preview Day 2 objectives: patterns and forecasting

### Station 2: Pattern Recognition (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Identifying patterns that predict weather changes
- **Activity:** Analyze 48-hour data sequences to identify approaching fronts
- **Spiral Connection:** Pattern identification from Cycle 3 (climate trends)

**Pattern Types to Identify:**
| Pattern | What It Shows | Prediction |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Falling pressure | Low approaching | Storms coming |
| Rising humidity + temp | Warm front approaching | Light rain |
| Rapid temp drop | Cold front passing | Clearing soon |
| Steady high pressure | High pressure system | Fair weather continues |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. How far in advance can we accurately predict weather? (3-7 days reliably)
2. Why do forecasts become less accurate further out? (Chaos, small changes amplify)
3. How is pattern recognition in weather similar to what we did in Cycle 3 with climate data?

### Station 3: Build Your Own Forecast (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Creating evidence-based weather predictions
- **Activity:** Given 48 hours of data, create a 24-hour forecast with confidence level
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-4 (Analyzing Data) + Constructing Explanations

**Forecast Template:**
1. **Current conditions:** (temperature, pressure, clouds)
2. **Data trends:** What patterns do you see in the last 48 hours?
3. **Prediction:** What weather do you expect in 24 hours?
4. **Evidence:** What data supports your prediction?
5. **Confidence level:** Low / Medium / High (with justification)

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to check students are citing specific data
- Prompt: "What would make you MORE confident in your prediction?"
- Ask: "What could go wrong with your forecast?"

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (data analysis, pattern recognition)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Week 1: air masses, fronts)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect data patterns to weather prediction)
  - 1 SEP-4 question (analyze data and draw conclusions)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Can students identify patterns in weather data?
- Can they connect data to predictions with evidence?
- Can they evaluate forecast reliability?

## Week 1 → Week 2 Connections

|----------------|---------------------|
| Air mass types (mT, cP, etc.) | Identify which air masses are affecting data |
| Frontal boundaries | Predict weather changes when fronts approach |
| Pressure systems (H, L) | Track pressure patterns to predict fronts |
| Weather map interpretation | Apply to real-time data analysis |

**Explicit Connection Script:**
"Last week, we learned to identify air masses and fronts on weather maps. This week, we'll learn how meteorologists USE data to predict where those fronts will go and what weather they'll bring. The air mass concepts are your foundation—now we add the data analysis skills."

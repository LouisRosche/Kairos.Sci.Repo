# Grade 7 Cycle 5 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Weather Prediction & Climate Patterns

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-5 (Primary), MS-ESS3-5 & MS-ESS3-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Phenomenon

**The Failed Forecast Mystery**
On March 17, 2024, meteorologists predicted sunny skies for a major outdoor event. By noon, a powerful thunderstorm moved in, catching everyone off guard. The forecast was accurate for 3 days before—what went wrong?

**Driving Question:** Why is weather so hard to predict more than a week out?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Collect and organize weather data from multiple sources
2. Identify patterns in temperature, pressure, and humidity data
3. Use data evidence to support weather predictions
4. Distinguish between weather variability and climate trends

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What did we learn about air masses and fronts last week?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Forecast vs actual weather comparison data
- **Driving Question:** Why do predictions become less accurate over time?
- **Week 1 Connection:** How do air mass movements create prediction challenges?
- **Materials:** 7-day forecast accuracy chart (embedded)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on weather vs climate distinction (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show how 1-day forecasts are ~95% accurate, but 7-day are only ~80%
- Connect to complexity of atmospheric systems
- "If we know the physics, why can't we predict perfectly?"

### Station 1: Data Collection & Analysis (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Interpret real weather data, identify patterns
- **Activity:** Analyze weather station datasets + graphing tools
- **Key Vocabulary:** Barometer, relative humidity, dew point, trend, correlation
- **Spiral Connection:** Climate change factors from Cycle 3

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- NOAA weather data (embedded links)
- Graphing templates (embedded)

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Weather predictions are just guesses" | Based on scientific data, physics, and computer models | Show forecast methodology |
| "Climate and weather are the same" | Weather is short-term; climate is 30+ year average | Explicit comparison |
| "Seasons caused by Earth's distance from sun" | Caused by Earth's axial tilt | Show hemisphere seasons |

**Tiered Support:**
- **Tier 1:** Sentence starters, graph reading guide
- **Tier 2:** Pre-structured data tables, worked examples
- **Tier 3:** One-on-one graphing support, reduced variables

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Weather prediction methods and chaos theory basics
- **Model:** Show how small changes cascade into big differences
- **Think-Aloud:** Walk through how meteorologists use data
- **Visual:** Butterfly effect concept for weather systems

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Weather systems are chaotic—small changes have big effects
2. More data = better predictions (but never perfect)
3. Models run thousands of simulations to find most likely outcome
4. Climate is more predictable because it's the average over time

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Compare different weather model predictions
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on data analysis methods

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Why do weather predictions get less accurate over time?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Climate vs Weather Investigation (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Distinguish weather variability from climate trends
- **Activity:** Analyze 30-year climate data alongside daily weather records
- **Spiral Connection:** Climate change from Cycle 3

**Data Sets:**
- Daily temperatures for March 2024 (high variability)
- 30-year March average temperatures (clear trend)
- Global temperature anomaly data

**Key Analysis:**
- Weather: Individual points vary widely day to day
- Climate: Average trend emerges over decades
- Signal vs noise: How do scientists find the trend?

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Can one cold day disprove global warming? (No—that's weather, not climate)
2. Why is 30 years the standard for climate data?
3. How can we experience winter AND global warming?

### Station 3: Design a Climate Monitoring Station (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Long-term data collection planning
- **Activity:** Design a monitoring system for 30-year data collection
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-4 (Analyzing and Interpreting Data) + Engineering Design

**Design Constraints:**
- Timeline: 30 years of continuous data
- Budget: $50,000 setup + $5,000/year maintenance
- Data: Temperature, precipitation, CO₂ levels
- Location: Must represent regional climate accurately

**Considerations:**
| Factor | Importance | Trade-offs |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Sensor accuracy | High | More accurate = more expensive |
| Data redundancy | Medium | Backup systems cost more |
| Location stability | Critical | Urban areas change over 30 years |
| Maintenance access | High | Remote = cheaper setup, expensive maintenance |

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Emphasize 30-year timeframe challenges (technology changes, funding)
- Ask: "How is this different from a weather station?"
- Prompt: "What could invalidate your data over 30 years?"

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (prediction accuracy, data analysis)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 3: climate change evidence)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect weather + climate)
  - 1 SEP-4 question (Data interpretation)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Can students distinguish weather from climate using data?
- Can they explain why predictions have limits?
- Can they design appropriate data collection methods?

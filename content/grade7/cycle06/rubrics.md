## Week 1 Rubrics: Plate Boundaries & Seismic Patterns

### Station 1: Convection Mechanism
**SEP:** Developing and Using Models | **DCI:** ESS2.A | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Explain how convection in Earth's mantle causes plate movement. Include the role of the asthenosphere.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Explains heat source + convection cycle + asthenosphere role + plate movement | "Heat from radioactive decay in Earth's core rises. Hot mantle material rises, cools, and sinks—creating convection cells. The asthenosphere is a weak, plastic layer that can flow slowly. Plates ride on this flowing asthenosphere, pushed by the convection currents." |
| **3** | Explains convection + asthenosphere OR complete convection without asthenosphere | "Hot material rises, cold sinks. This pushes the plates that sit on top." |
| **2** | Partial explanation of convection | "Heat makes things move. The plates float on the hot mantle." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Plates float on liquid magma like boats on water." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 pattern: "Liquid magma" → Clarify asthenosphere is plastic solid
- Score 2 pattern: Missing mechanism → Review convection cell diagram

### Station 2: Boundary Identification
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** ESS2.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** You observe: earthquakes, a deep ocean trench, and volcanoes. What type of boundary is this? Explain.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct (convergent) + explains all three features + mechanism | "This is a convergent boundary where plates push together. One plate subducts under the other, creating a trench. The subducting plate melts, creating magma that rises to form volcanoes. The pressure from collision causes earthquakes." |
| **3** | Correct type + explains 2 of 3 features | "Convergent boundary. The trench forms where one plate goes under another, and volcanoes form from melting." |
| **2** | Correct type + minimal explanation | "Convergent because there are trenches and volcanoes." |
| **1** | Wrong type or major errors | "Divergent boundary because there are earthquakes." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Engineering Design
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** ESS2.B | **CCC:** Systems and System Models

**Question:** Design a building to withstand earthquakes at a transform boundary. Justify your choices within $2M budget.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Within budget + justified choices + trade-offs + connects to boundary | "At a transform boundary, buildings experience horizontal shaking. I'd use: base isolators ($300k) to let the building move, cross-bracing ($150k) for lateral strength, and dampers ($250k) to absorb energy. Total: $700k, leaving buffer for foundation. Trade-off: no shear walls means more windows but less stiffness." |
| **4** | Within budget + justified choices + trade-offs | "Base isolators and dampers because the building needs to move. Under budget." |
| **3** | Within budget + some justification | "I'd add all the safety features. $1.1 million total." |
| **2** | Budget error OR missing justification | "Just make it really strong." |
| **1** | Major design flaws | "Build it rigid so it doesn't move." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration
**SEP-6 + DCI ESS2.B + CCC-1**

**Question:** A student claims: "Earthquakes happen randomly all over Earth." Use evidence from the earthquake map to evaluate this claim.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Refutes claim + pattern description + plate boundary connection | "The claim is wrong. The earthquake map shows earthquakes cluster along specific lines—the Ring of Fire, Mediterranean, and mid-ocean ridges. These lines match plate boundaries where plates interact. Earthquakes happen where stress builds between plates, not randomly." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Refutes + mentions boundaries | "Earthquakes aren't random—they happen at plate boundaries." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Refutes but weak evidence | "The map shows they're not random." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Accepts claim | "Earthquakes do seem pretty random." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Week 2 Rubrics: Seafloor Spreading & Continental Drift

### Station 1: Magnetic Stripe Evidence
**SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data | **DCI:** ESS2.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** The diagram shows magnetic stripes on the ocean floor symmetric around a ridge. What does this prove?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Identifies spreading + explains magnetic reversals + symmetry significance | "The symmetric stripes prove seafloor spreading. When lava cools at the ridge, iron minerals align with Earth's magnetic field. The field reverses periodically, creating alternating stripes. Symmetric stripes on both sides mean new rock forms at the center and spreads outward equally." |
| **3** | Identifies spreading + partial explanation | "This proves seafloor spreading. New rock forms at the ridge and moves outward, recording magnetic reversals." |
| **2** | Identifies spreading + minimal explanation | "It shows the seafloor is spreading from the middle." |
| **1** | Misinterprets pattern | "The stripes show different types of rock." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Continental Drift Evidence
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** ESS2.B | **CCC:** Patterns

**Question:** Mesosaurus fossils are found in both South America and Africa. Mesosaurus was a freshwater reptile that couldn't swim across oceans. What does this tell us?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Concludes drift + explains significance + testable prediction | "This is evidence that South America and Africa were once connected. Mesosaurus lived in freshwater and couldn't cross the ocean, so the continents must have been joined when it was alive. If this is true, we should find matching rock types on both continents too—and we do!" |
| **3** | Concludes drift + explains why fossils matter | "The continents were once connected. Mesosaurus couldn't swim across the ocean, so the land must have been together." |
| **2** | Concludes drift + minimal explanation | "South America and Africa used to be connected." |
| **1** | Incorrect explanation | "Mesosaurus must have been able to swim further than we thought." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 3: Measurement Design
**SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | **DCI:** ESS2.B | **CCC:** Scale, Proportion, and Quantity

**Question:** Design a system to detect 2.5 cm/year plate movement over 5 years. What precision do you need? Justify your technology choice.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Correct precision + justified technology + budget considered + timeline | "Over 5 years, 2.5 cm/year = 12.5 cm total movement. I need precision of at least 1 cm to see the pattern. GPS stations ($50k each) have 1 mm/year precision—perfect. I'd use 4 stations at $200k total, leaving budget for 5 years of data processing. Monthly measurements would show the trend clearly." |
| **4** | Correct precision + justified technology | "Need sub-centimeter precision to see 2.5 cm/year. GPS would work." |
| **3** | Reasonable technology choice + partial reasoning | "GPS stations can detect small movements over years." |
| **2** | Technology without precision reasoning | "Use GPS satellites to track the plates." |
| **1** | Unrealistic plan | "Just measure with a ruler each year." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | All 5 elements labeled correctly + arrows showing motion + stripes symmetric |
| **4** | 4-5 elements + mostly correct relationships |
| **3** | 3-4 elements + some correct relationships |
| **2** | 2-3 elements + incomplete understanding |
| **1** | 1-2 elements or major errors |
| **0** | No response |

### Part 2: System Explanation

**Question:** Explain why the oldest ocean crust is only ~200 million years old, while continental crust is billions of years old.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **5** | Explains recycling + creation/destruction balance + continental persistence | "Ocean crust is constantly recycled. New crust forms at divergent boundaries (ridges), moves across the ocean, and is destroyed at convergent boundaries (subduction zones). This cycle takes ~200 million years. Continental crust is too buoyant to subduct—it floats on the mantle and accumulates over billions of years." |
| **4** | Explains recycling + creation/destruction | "Ocean crust gets subducted and recycled. Continental crust doesn't subduct." |
| **3** | Mentions recycling + partial mechanism | "Ocean floor is destroyed at trenches." |
| **2** | Recognizes difference without mechanism | "Ocean crust is younger because it gets replaced." |
| **1** | Major misconceptions | "Ocean crust wears away faster from water." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Part 3: Misconception Check

**Question:** TRUE or FALSE: "Plates float on liquid magma." Explain your answer.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | FALSE + explains asthenosphere is plastic solid + convection | "FALSE. Plates rest on the asthenosphere, which is a plastic solid—not liquid. It can flow slowly over millions of years but isn't liquid like water. Think of it like silly putty: solid but can deform. Convection in this layer moves the plates, but they don't 'float' on liquid." |
| **3** | FALSE + explains asthenosphere isn't liquid | "FALSE. The asthenosphere is a plastic solid, not liquid magma." |
| **2** | FALSE + minimal explanation | "FALSE. It's not actually liquid underneath." |
| **1** | TRUE or confused reasoning | "TRUE, the magma is hot and liquid so plates can float." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

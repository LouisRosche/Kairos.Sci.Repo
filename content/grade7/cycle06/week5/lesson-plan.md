## Targeted Misconceptions (Cycle-Wide)

| Misconception ID | Common Wrong Thinking | Correct Understanding |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| plates-float-magma | "Plates float on liquid magma like boats on water" | Plates rest on the plastic asthenosphere (solid but flowing slowly); mantle is NOT liquid |
| continents-move-fast | "Continents move quickly and noticeably" | Plate movement is fingernail-growth speed (~2-10 cm/year); takes millions of years |
| earthquakes-random | "Earthquakes happen randomly anywhere" | Earthquakes cluster at plate boundaries; predictable patterns exist |

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check
- "Today we begin our Cycle 6 assessment. You'll show what you've learned about plate tectonics and Earth's interior."
- Brief reminder of assessment format

### Part 1: Synthesis Review (15 min | 20 pts)
**Purpose:** Connect concepts from all four weeks before main assessment

**Key Connections to Make:**
1. Plate boundaries → Earthquakes → Seismic waves → Earth's interior
2. Mantle convection drives plate movement AND creates volcanic activity
3. Evidence chain: Magnetic stripes + fossils + continents fitting = Pangaea
4. Seismic shadow zones prove layered Earth structure

**Questions Focus:**
| Question | Content | Points |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Q1 | Plate boundaries and earthquake patterns | 4 pts |
| Q2 | Evidence for continental drift | 4 pts |
| Q3 | Volcanic activity at plate boundaries | 4 pts |
| Q4 | Seismic evidence for Earth's interior | 4 pts |
| Q5 | Full system integration | 4 pts |

**Teacher Notes:**
- This is formative—help students make connections before main assessment
- Walk through the evidence chain from surface to interior
- Remind students: All these processes are connected through Earth's internal heat!

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (40 min | 60 pts)
**Structure:** 4 sections, 15 pts each

#### Section A: Plate Boundaries (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| A1 | Divergent boundary characteristics | 3 pts |
| A2 | Convergent boundary types | 4 pts |
| A3 | Transform boundary earthquakes | 4 pts |
| A4 | Boundary type identification | 4 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- Divergent = spreading apart, new crust created
- Convergent = coming together, subduction or collision
- Transform = sliding past, earthquakes but no volcanism
- Real-world examples (San Andreas, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Cascades)

#### Section B: Seafloor Evidence (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| B1 | Magnetic stripes and reversal evidence | 4 pts |
| B2 | Seafloor age patterns | 4 pts |
| B3 | Continental drift evidence | 4 pts |
| B4 | Pangaea reconstruction | 3 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- Magnetic stripe symmetry around ridges
- Youngest seafloor at ridges, oldest near continents
- Multiple evidence types for Pangaea (fossils, rocks, coastlines, climate)

#### Section C: Volcanic Systems (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| C1 | Magma viscosity and eruption style | 4 pts |
| C2 | Volcano locations and plate boundaries | 4 pts |
| C3 | Volcanic hazards | 4 pts |
| C4 | Hot spots vs boundary volcanism | 3 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- High silica = high viscosity = explosive (stratovolcanoes)
- Low silica = low viscosity = effusive (shield volcanoes)
- Most volcanoes at convergent boundaries (Ring of Fire)
- Hot spots create chains as plates move over them

#### Section D: Earth's Interior (15 pts)
| Question | Topic | Points |
|----------|-------|--------|
| D1 | P-wave and S-wave properties | 4 pts |
| D2 | Shadow zone evidence | 4 pts |
| D3 | Layer properties and density | 4 pts |
| D4 | Core composition evidence | 3 pts |

**Key Concepts Assessed:**
- P-waves through solids AND liquids; S-waves only solids
- S-wave shadow zone proves liquid outer core
- Density increases toward center (differentiation)
- Iron-nickel core matches density + magnetism + meteorites

### Direct Instruction (10 min)
- Review any challenging concepts observed during Part 2
- Address common errors before Part 3
- Prepare students for misconception-focused questions

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Extended time for Part 2 completion
- **Extension:** Independent research on current tectonic research
- **Remediation:** Targeted review for struggling students

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "Yesterday we completed the main assessment. Today we'll check understanding of the trickiest concepts."
- Preview Part 3 format

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 min | 20 pts)
**Purpose:** Target persistent misconceptions that affect deep understanding

| Question | Misconception Target | Points |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| M1 | plates-float-magma | 4 pts |
| M2 | continents-move-fast | 4 pts |
| M3 | earthquakes-random | 4 pts |
| M4 | mantle-is-liquid (from W4) | 4 pts |
| M5 | Synthesis: connecting all concepts | 4 pts |

**Misconception Check Details:**

**M1 (plates-float-magma):**
- Wrong: "Tectonic plates float on liquid magma"
- Correct: Plates rest on the asthenosphere (upper mantle), which is SOLID but flows slowly like plastic over millions of years

**M2 (continents-move-fast):**
- Wrong: "Continents move quickly enough to notice"
- Correct: Plates move 2-10 cm/year—fingernail growth speed. Takes millions of years to see major changes.

**M3 (earthquakes-random):**
- Wrong: "Earthquakes happen randomly anywhere on Earth"
- Correct: ~95% of earthquakes occur at plate boundaries in predictable zones

**M4 (mantle-is-liquid):**
- Wrong: "The mantle is liquid magma under the crust"
- Correct: S-waves travel through the mantle, proving it's solid. Only small pockets melt to form magma.

**M5 (synthesis):**
- Connect understanding of Earth's dynamic systems
- How interior heat drives surface processes

### Post-Assessment Debrief (15 min)
- Review most challenging questions as a class
- Celebrate growth from beginning of cycle
- Preview Cycle 7 connections (Rock Cycle)

### MTSS Data Collection
- Record individual scores by section
- Identify students needing intervention before Cycle 7
- Flag misconceptions that persist for targeted reteaching

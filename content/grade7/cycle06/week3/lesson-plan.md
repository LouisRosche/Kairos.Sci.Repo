# Grade 7 Cycle 6 Week 3 Lesson Plan
## Synthesis & Assessment

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-2 (Primary), MS-ESS2-5, MS-ESS3-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Focus
Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycles 4-5

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Connect plate boundaries to seafloor spreading and continental drift
2. Apply geoscience concepts to novel scenarios
3. Demonstrate understanding of evidence-based explanations
4. Integrate concepts from Cycles 4-6 in system-level explanations

---

## Day 1: Synthesis & Review

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check
- Overview of Week 3 assessment structure
- "Today we'll review and connect everything from Weeks 1-2"

### Part 1: Synthesis (20 pts | ~15 min)
- **Focus:** Connect W1 plate boundaries + W2 evidence for movement
- **Format:** Short-answer and diagram-based questions

**Synthesis Questions:**
1. Draw a cross-section showing a divergent boundary with magnetic stripes
2. Explain how the evidence from Week 2 confirms the boundary types from Week 1
3. Why does plate recycling (creation at ridges, destruction at trenches) matter?

**Key Connections to Make:**
| Week 1 Concept | Week 2 Application | Integration |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Divergent boundaries | Seafloor spreading evidence | Stripes prove spreading |
| Convergent boundaries | Subduction and recycling | Explains missing old ocean crust |
| Convection mechanism | Continental drift over time | How plates actually move |

### Spiral Review Station (25 min)
- **Small groups rotate through review stations**
- Station A: Cycle 4 concepts (ocean chemistry, human impact)
- Station B: Cycle 5 concepts (convection in atmosphere, patterns)
- Station C: Cycle 6 Week 1 (plate boundaries, convection in mantle)
- Station D: Cycle 6 Week 2 (seafloor spreading, continental drift)

**Materials per station:**
- Review cards with key concepts
- Practice problems
- Self-check answer sheets

### Direct Instruction: Assessment Prep (10 min)
- Review assessment format and expectations
- Highlight common misconception traps
- Provide test-taking strategies for evidence-based explanations

---

## Day 2: Cumulative Assessment

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (60 pts | ~40 min)

**Section A: Plate Boundaries (15 pts)**
- Identify boundary types from diagrams and descriptions
- Explain convection as the driving mechanism
- Predict geological features at each boundary type

**Section B: Seafloor Evidence (15 pts)**
- Interpret magnetic stripe patterns
- Explain how stripes support spreading
- Calculate approximate spreading rates

**Section C: Continental Drift (15 pts)**
- Use multiple lines of evidence to support drift
- Explain why Alfred Wegener's ideas were initially rejected
- Describe how plate tectonics resolved the mechanism problem

**Section D: System Explanations (15 pts)**
- Construct explanation for earthquake pattern at Ring of Fire
- Connect multiple concepts (boundaries, movement, evidence)
- Apply understanding to novel scenario (predict features at unknown boundary)

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 pts | ~20 min)

**Target Misconceptions:**
| Misconception | Question Type | Correct Understanding |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Plates float on liquid magma | True/False with reasoning | Asthenosphere is plastic solid |
| Continents move fast | Calculation | 1-10 cm/year (fingernail growth) |
| Earthquakes are random | Map analysis | Cluster at plate boundaries |
| Ocean floor is ancient | Age comparison | Oldest ~200 Ma (young!) |

**Format:**
- Each misconception has 5-point question
- Must identify whether statement is correct
- Must explain WHY with evidence from unit

## Assessment Structure Summary

| Component | Points | Time | Focus |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min | Connect W1 + W2 |
| Part 2: Cumulative | 60 | ~40 min | All cycle content |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min | Persistent errors |
| **Total** | **100** | **~75 min** | |

## MTSS Considerations

### Tier 1 (Universal)
- Sentence starters for evidence-based explanations
- Word bank with cycle vocabulary
- Diagram templates for cross-sections

### Tier 2 (Targeted)
- Extended time (up to 1.5x)
- Reduced question load (prioritized items)
- Reference sheet with boundary types

### Tier 3 (Intensive)
- Alternative assessment format (oral responses)
- One-on-one administration option
- Modified rubrics focusing on core concepts

---

## Materials List

### Digital Resources
- [ ] Chromebooks (class set)
- [ ] Google Forms for assessment
- [ ] Review station materials (embedded)

### Physical Materials
- [ ] Notecards (for reference)
- [ ] Scratch paper for calculations
- [ ] Colored pencils for diagrams

---

## Post-Assessment

### Data Analysis
- Track misconception persistence by question
- Compare to Cycle 4-5 performance
- Identify students needing Tier 2/3 support for Cycle 7

### Intervention Planning
- Schedule targeted reteach for persistent misconceptions
- Create peer tutoring pairs based on strength areas
- Prepare modified materials for Cycle 7 as needed

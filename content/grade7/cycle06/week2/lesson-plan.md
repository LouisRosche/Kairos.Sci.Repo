# Grade 7 Cycle 6 Week 2 Lesson Plan
## Seafloor Spreading & Continental Drift

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-2 (Primary), MS-ESS2-5 & MS-ESS3-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

---

## Phenomenon

**The Underwater Mountain Mystery**
The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a 10,000-mile underwater mountain range running down the center of the Atlantic Ocean. New rock is constantly forming here—and it's pushing the continents apart. Europe and North America move about 2.5 cm farther apart each year.

**Driving Question:** How can mountains exist on the ocean floor?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Interpret magnetic stripe evidence for seafloor spreading
2. Use multiple lines of evidence to support continental drift
3. Explain how spreading and subduction maintain plate recycling
4. Design systems to detect plate movement

---

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What are the three types of plate boundaries?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Mid-Atlantic Ridge bathymetry + volcanic footage
- **Driving Question:** How can mountains exist on the ocean floor?
- **Week 1 Connection:** "We learned divergent boundaries pull apart. What happens at that gap?"
- **Materials:** Bathymetry visualization (embedded)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on boundary types (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Show the ridge as a divergent boundary in action
- Ask: "If plates are moving apart, why isn't there a hole?"
- Connect to Week 1 divergent boundary concept

### Station 1: Seafloor Spreading Evidence (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Interpret magnetic stripe evidence for spreading
- **Activity:** Analyze magnetic stripe data from ocean floor + age maps
- **Key Vocabulary:** Magnetic reversal, polarity, spreading rate, mid-ocean ridge
- **Spiral Connection:** Human impact on ocean systems from Cycle 4

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- Magnetic stripe visualization (embedded)
- Seafloor age map (embedded)

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Ocean floor is ancient" | Oldest ocean crust ~200 million years (young!) | Compare to continental crust (billions of years old) |
| "Magnetic stripes are painted on" | Stripes form as lava cools and records Earth's field | Iron compass needle analogy |
| "Spreading destroys rock" | Spreading creates; subduction destroys (recycling) | Conveyor belt model |

**Tiered Support:**
- **Tier 1:** Sentence starters, magnetic field diagram
- **Tier 2:** Pre-labeled stripe diagram, age calculation guide
- **Tier 3:** One-on-one magnetic concept review, simplified data

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Evidence for seafloor spreading
- **Model:** Draw spreading ridge with magnetic stripes forming symmetrically
- **Think-Aloud:** How do symmetric stripes prove spreading?
- **Visual:** Animation of magnetic reversal recording in cooling lava

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Magma rises at divergent boundaries and cools into new rock
2. Iron minerals in cooling lava align with Earth's magnetic field
3. Earth's field reverses periodically (recorded in stripes)
4. Symmetric stripes on both sides = spreading from center

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Calculate spreading rates from age data
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on evidence evaluation

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What evidence supports seafloor spreading?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Pangaea Puzzle Investigation (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Multiple lines of evidence for continental drift
- **Activity:** Use continental cutouts and fossil distribution to reconstruct Pangaea
- **Spiral Connection:** Pattern recognition from weather/climate data

**Lines of Evidence:**
| Evidence Type | Description | Significance |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Continental shapes | Coastlines fit together (puzzle pieces) | First hint of drift |
| Fossil distribution | Same fossils on separated continents | Couldn't swim across ocean |
| Rock types | Matching mountain chains and rock formations | Formed when connected |
| Climate evidence | Glacial deposits in tropical areas | Continents were in different positions |
| Magnetic stripes | Symmetric patterns at ridges | Active spreading today |

**Discussion Questions:**
1. Why wasn't continental drift accepted when first proposed? (No mechanism)
2. How do multiple lines of evidence strengthen the argument?
3. What would you expect to find if drift is true? (Testable predictions)

### Station 3: Design a Plate Movement Detector (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply understanding to measurement challenge
- **Activity:** Design GPS-based system to detect plate movement
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations) + Engineering Design

**Design Constraints:**
- Budget: $500,000 for 5-year study
- Precision: Detect movement to 1 mm/year
- Coverage: Monitor 3 plate boundaries
- Data: Position, velocity, direction

**Available Technologies:**
| Option | Cost | Precision | Trade-offs |
|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| GPS Station (fixed) | $50k each | 1 mm/year | Needs clear sky view |
| Laser Ranging | $200k | 0.1 mm/year | Expensive, weather-dependent |
| VLBI (radio astronomy) | $150k | 0.5 mm/year | Requires multiple stations |
| Tide Gauges | $25k | 5 mm/year | Indirect, sea level affected by other factors |

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to check budget and precision requirements
- Ask: "How long would you need to collect data to see 5 cm of movement?"
- Connect to the patience required for plate tectonic research

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (seafloor spreading and continental drift evidence)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 5: data collection methods; Cycle 4: ocean systems)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect magnetic evidence to plate movement)
  - 1 SEP-6 question (Construct explanation using multiple evidence types)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Can students explain how magnetic stripes support spreading?
- Can they use multiple lines of evidence for continental drift?
- Can they design appropriate measurement systems?

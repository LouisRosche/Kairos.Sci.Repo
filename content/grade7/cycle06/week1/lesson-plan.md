# Grade 7 Cycle 6 Week 1 Lesson Plan
## Plate Boundaries & Seismic Patterns

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-2 (Primary), MS-ESS2-5 & MS-ESS3-3 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Earthquake Pattern Mystery**
Looking at a global earthquake map, earthquakes cluster along specific lines—the "Ring of Fire" around the Pacific, a line through the Mediterranean, and a zigzag pattern down the Atlantic. These aren't random. They reveal something hidden beneath Earth's surface.

**Driving Question:** Why do earthquakes happen in the same places over and over?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain how convection in the mantle drives plate movement
2. Identify the three types of plate boundaries and their features
3. Connect plate boundary type to earthquake and volcanic patterns
4. Apply understanding to earthquake engineering challenges

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question on board
- Quick review: "What did we learn about convection in weather systems?"

### Hook (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Global earthquake map (USGS last 30 days) + Ring of Fire visual
- **Driving Question:** Why do earthquakes cluster at specific locations?
- **Cycle 5 Connection:** "We learned convection drives air masses. What else might convection drive?"
- **Materials:** USGS earthquake map (embedded)
- **MTSS Check:** Quick diagnostic on density/convection from Cycle 5 (0 pts)

**Teacher Notes:**
- Let students observe and describe the pattern BEFORE explaining
- Connect explicitly to convection from Cycle 5
- "The atmosphere has convection. What if Earth's interior does too?"

### Station 1: Convection & Plate Movement (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Connect heat transfer to plate motion mechanism
- **Activity:** Analyze convection demonstration video + plate movement model
- **Key Vocabulary:** Mantle, asthenosphere, lithosphere, convection cell
- **Spiral Connection:** Convection in atmosphere from Cycle 5

**Materials:**
- Chromebooks (class set)
- Convection demonstration video (embedded)
- Mantle convection diagram (embedded)

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Correct Understanding | How to Address |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| "Plates float on liquid magma" | Asthenosphere is plastic solid, not liquid | Play-doh analogy—deforms but not liquid |
| "Continents move fast" | 1-10 cm/year (fingernail growth rate) | Calculate: how far in your lifetime? |
| "Heat comes from the sun" | Internal heat from radioactive decay | Earth's core is hotter than sun's surface |

**Tiered Support:**
- **Tier 1:** Sentence starters, convection diagram labels
- **Tier 2:** Pre-labeled diagrams, side-by-side atmosphere/mantle comparison
- **Tier 3:** One-on-one convection review, simplified model

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Earth's layers and plate movement mechanism
- **Model:** Draw cross-section with lithosphere, asthenosphere, mantle, core
- **Think-Aloud:** Walk through how heat drives convection → moves plates
- **Visual:** Animation of convection cells and plate motion

**Key Points to Model:**
1. Earth's interior is hot (radioactive decay)
2. Hot material rises, cold material sinks (convection)
3. Asthenosphere is plastic solid—flows slowly over millions of years
4. Lithospheric plates ride on top of convecting asthenosphere

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete unfinished stations
- **Extension:** Research specific earthquake events and their plate boundaries
- **Rotation:** G7/G8 grade swap on Earth processes

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What drives plate movement?"
- Review key vocabulary from Day 1
- Preview Day 2 objectives

### Station 2: Plate Boundary Analysis (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Classify boundaries, predict geological features
- **Activity:** Match boundary types to features using data cards and world map
- **Spiral Connection:** Pattern recognition from Cycle 5 weather maps

**Boundary Types:**
| Type | Motion | Features | Example |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Divergent | Pulling apart | Mid-ocean ridges, rift valleys | Mid-Atlantic Ridge |
| Convergent | Pushing together | Mountains, trenches, volcanoes | Andes, Himalayas |
| Transform | Sliding past | Earthquakes, fault lines | San Andreas Fault |

**Key Analysis:**
- Why are most volcanoes at convergent boundaries? (Subduction → melting)
- Why is the Ring of Fire so active? (Convergent and transform boundaries)
- Why are earthquakes shallow at ridges but deep at trenches?

### Station 3: Design an Earthquake-Resistant Structure (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Apply boundary knowledge to engineering challenge
- **Activity:** Design building features to withstand seismic forces
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-6 (Constructing Explanations) + Engineering Design

**Design Constraints:**
- Budget: $2 million construction
- Location: San Francisco (transform boundary)
- Building: 10-story office building
- Must withstand magnitude 7.0 earthquake

**Available Strategies:**
| Feature | Cost | Effectiveness | Trade-offs |
|---------|------|---------------|------------|
| Base isolators | $300k | High | Expensive installation |
| Moment-resisting frame | $400k | Medium-high | Limits floor plan flexibility |
| Shear walls | $200k | Medium | Limits window placement |
| Cross-bracing | $150k | Medium | Visible in design |
| Dampers | $250k | High | Maintenance required |

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Circulate to check budget calculations
- Ask: "Why does the building need to MOVE, not stay rigid?"
- Connect to plate boundary forces at transform boundaries

### Exit Ticket (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (plate boundaries and convection)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Cycle 5: convection in weather systems)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (connect atmospheric and mantle convection)
  - 1 SEP-6 question (Constructing explanation for earthquake pattern)

**Assessment Focus:**
- Can students explain what drives plate movement?
- Can they identify boundary types from features?
- Can they explain why earthquakes cluster at boundaries?

## Cycle 5 → Cycle 6 Connections

| Cycle 5 Concept | Cycle 6 Application |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Convection in atmosphere | Convection in mantle (same physics, different scale) |
| Air mass density | Rock density and plate buoyancy |
| Weather patterns | Earthquake patterns at boundaries |
| Data collection (weather) | Data collection (seismic) |

**Explicit Connection Script:**
"In Cycle 5, we learned that convection in the atmosphere creates weather patterns. The same physics works inside Earth—hot material rises, cold material sinks. This convection moves the tectonic plates, which creates the earthquake patterns we observed."

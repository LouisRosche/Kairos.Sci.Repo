## Anchoring Phenomenon

**Why do earthquakes happen in the same places over and over?**

Looking at a global earthquake map, students will notice that earthquakes cluster along specific lines and zones—not randomly scattered. This pattern reveals the hidden structure of Earth's tectonic plates and their boundaries.

## Week-by-Week Structure

### Week 1: Plate Boundaries & Seismic Patterns
**Phenomenon:** Why do earthquakes cluster at specific locations?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Earthquake Pattern Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Convection & Plate Movement | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Plate Boundary Analysis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design an Earthquake-Resistant Structure | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Plate Dynamics Integration | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Explain how convection in the mantle drives plate movement
2. Identify the three types of plate boundaries and their features
3. Connect plate boundary type to earthquake and volcanic patterns
4. Apply understanding to earthquake engineering challenges

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Plates float on liquid magma" → Plates rest on plastic solid (asthenosphere); convection drives motion
- "Continents move fast" → 1-10 cm/year (fingernail growth rate)
- "Earthquakes happen randomly" → Cluster at plate boundaries where stress builds

### Week 2: Seafloor Spreading & Continental Drift
**Phenomenon:** How can mountains exist on the ocean floor?

| Component | Title | Points | Time |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|
| Hook | The Underwater Mountain Mystery | 12 | ~10 min |
| Station 1 | Seafloor Spreading Evidence | 20 | ~18 min |
| Station 2 | Pangaea Puzzle Investigation | 20 | ~15 min |
| Station 3 | Design a Plate Movement Detector | 25 | ~20 min |
| Exit Ticket | Earth's Dynamic Surface Integration | 23 | ~15 min |

**Learning Targets:**
1. Interpret magnetic stripe evidence for seafloor spreading
2. Use multiple lines of evidence to support continental drift
3. Explain how spreading and subduction maintain plate recycling
4. Design systems to detect plate movement

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Continents always looked the same" → Pangaea ~300 million years ago
- "Ocean floor is ancient" → Oldest ocean crust ~200 million years (young!)
- "Evidence for drift is only fossils" → Multiple lines: fossils, rocks, shapes, magnetic stripes

### Week 3: Synthesis & Assessment
**Focus:** Integration of Weeks 1 & 2 + Spiral from Cycles 4-5

| Component | Points | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Part 1: Synthesis | 20 | ~15 min |
| Part 2: Cumulative Assessment | 60 | ~40 min |
| Part 3: Misconception Check | 20 | ~20 min |

## Cycle 5 → Cycle 6 Connections

| Cycle 5 Concept | Cycle 6 Application |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Convection in atmosphere | Convection in mantle (same physics, different scale) |
| Air mass density | Rock density and plate buoyancy |
| Weather patterns | Earthquake/volcanic patterns at boundaries |
| Climate vs weather timescales | Geologic vs human timescales |

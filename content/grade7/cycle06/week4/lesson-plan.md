# Grade 7 Cycle 6 Week 4 Lesson Plan
## Earth's Interior Structure & Evidence

**NGSS Standards:** MS-ESS2-1, MS-ESS2-3 (Primary), MS-ESS2-2 (Spiral)
**Duration:** 2 days (~75 min each)
**Total Points:** 100

## Phenomenon

**The Unreachable Mystery**
The deepest hole ever drilled is the Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia—about 12 kilometers deep. It took 24 years to drill! But here's the problem: Earth's radius is about 6,371 kilometers. That means we've only scratched 0.2% of the way to the center! Yet scientists confidently describe Earth's interior layers, their composition, and even their temperatures.

**Driving Question:** How do we know what's inside Earth if no one has ever been there?

---

## Learning Targets
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
1. Explain how seismic waves reveal Earth's interior structure
2. Describe the properties of Earth's four main layers (crust, mantle, outer core, inner core)
3. Use density and seismic evidence to support claims about Earth's composition
4. Construct a model of Earth's interior based on indirect evidence

## Targeted Misconceptions

| Misconception ID | Wrong Thinking | Correct Understanding |
|------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| earth-hollow-inside | "Earth is hollow or has large empty caves inside" | Earth is composed of increasingly dense layers; the core is solid iron/nickel under immense pressure |
| earth-uniform | "Earth is the same material all the way through" | Earth has distinct layers (crust, mantle, outer core, inner core) with different compositions and properties |
| mantle-is-liquid | "The mantle is liquid magma that plates float on" | The mantle is mostly solid rock that flows very slowly like plastic; only small pockets melt to form magma |

## Day 1 Structure

### Opening Routine (5 min)
- Attendance & materials check (Chromebooks)
- Display driving question: "How can we know what's inside something we've never seen?"
- Quick review: "What forces and processes have we studied so far in plate tectonics?"

### Hook: The Unreachable Mystery (10 min | 12 pts)
- **Phenomenon:** Kola Borehole depth vs Earth's radius comparison
- **Driving Question:** How do scientists know about Earth's interior without direct observation?
- **Week Connection:** "We've studied plate tectonics at the surface. Now we go deeper—literally!"
- **Resource:** Scale diagram + core comparison visual

**Teacher Notes:**
- Dramatic reveal: 12 km vs 6,371 km (0.2%!)
- Apple analogy: Borehole barely penetrates the "skin"
- Key constraint: Heat and pressure destroy drilling equipment
- Introduce solution: Seismic waves—like an ultrasound for the planet

### Station 1: Seismic Wave Investigation (18 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Understand how P-waves and S-waves reveal Earth's structure
- **Activity:** Use seismic wave simulation to observe wave behavior
- **Key Vocabulary:** P-waves, S-waves, shadow zone, seismic evidence
- **Spiral Connection:** Wave energy concepts from earlier cycles

**Investigation Protocol:**
1. Trigger earthquake in simulation
2. Observe P-wave and S-wave travel paths
3. Identify where S-waves disappear (shadow zone)
4. Note wave speed changes at layer boundaries
5. Infer what causes observed patterns

**Key Observations:**
| Wave Type | Properties | What It Reveals |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| P-waves (Primary) | Fast, travel through solids AND liquids | Arrive first; pass through all layers |
| S-waves (Secondary) | Slower, only travel through solids | Shadow zone proves liquid outer core |
| Speed changes | Waves speed up/slow down at boundaries | Different layers have different properties |

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
| Misconception | Response | Evidence |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| "The mantle is liquid magma" | S-waves travel through mantle | If mantle were liquid, S-waves would stop there |
| "We just guessed about layers" | Multiple evidence types converge | Seismic data from thousands of earthquakes worldwide |

### Direct Instruction (15 min)
- **Topic:** Interpreting seismic evidence
- **Model:** How shadow zones reveal liquid outer core
- **Think-Aloud:** "S-waves stop at 2,900 km. What material property stops S-waves but not P-waves?"
- **Visual:** Earth cross-section with wave paths and shadow zones

**Key Points to Model:**
1. S-waves only travel through solids
2. S-wave shadow zone = liquid layer exists (outer core)
3. Wave speed changes indicate different materials
4. Scientists build models to explain ALL observations

### Wednesday Flex Options
- **Catch-up:** Complete seismic wave observations
- **Extension:** Research recent seismic discoveries (inner inner core?)
- **Rotation:** Wave behavior comparison with G8

## Day 2 Structure

### Quick Review (5 min)
- "What do P-waves and S-waves tell us about Earth's interior?"
- Review shadow zone concept
- Preview: "Today we'll examine each layer's properties"

### Station 2: Earth's Layers Analysis (15 min | 20 pts)
- **Focus:** Understand properties of each Earth layer
- **Activity:** Analyze density, temperature, and composition data
- **Key Vocabulary:** Crust, mantle, outer core, inner core, differentiation
- **Data:** Layer density gradient (2.7 → 13 g/cm³)

**Earth's Layers Reference:**
| Layer | Depth | State | Composition | Density |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Crust | 0-70 km | Solid | Rock (silicates) | 2.7 g/cm³ |
| Mantle | 70-2,900 km | Solid (flows slowly) | Rock (peridotite) | 4.5 g/cm³ |
| Outer Core | 2,900-5,150 km | Liquid | Iron-nickel | 10 g/cm³ |
| Inner Core | 5,150-6,371 km | Solid | Iron-nickel | 13 g/cm³ |

**Key Questions to Address:**
1. Why does density increase toward center? (Differentiation—dense iron sank)
2. Why is inner core solid despite being hotter? (Extreme pressure)
3. How can solid mantle "flow"? (Plastic behavior over millions of years)

### Station 3: Design an Earth Model (20 min | 25 pts)
- **Focus:** Construct and defend a model based on evidence
- **Activity:** Design a layered Earth model that explains ALL seismic observations
- **SEP Alignment:** SEP-2 (Developing and Using Models)

**Design Challenge:**
You're a geophysicist in 1906. Using only seismic data, construct a model of Earth's interior that explains:
1. P-waves arrive everywhere (travel through all materials)
2. S-waves have shadow zones (blocked by something)
3. Wave speeds change at certain depths (different materials)
4. Average density is 5.5 g/cm³ but surface is only 2.7 g/cm³

**Design Requirements:**
1. Specify number of layers
2. Identify whether each layer is solid or liquid
3. Predict composition based on density requirements
4. Cite evidence for each design choice

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Guide toward minimum 3-4 layers to explain all observations
- Connect density to iron core (meteorite evidence)
- Discuss how models are tested and refined over time

### Exit Ticket: Earth's Interior Integration (15 min | 23 pts)
- **Structure:**
  - 2 NEW questions (core composition, pressure effects)
  - 2 SPIRAL questions (Week 1-2: plate tectonics connection, Week 3: magma source)
  - 1 INTEGRATION question (multiple evidence types)
  - 1 SEP question (Model modification for new data)

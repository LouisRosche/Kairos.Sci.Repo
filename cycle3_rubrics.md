## Grade 7 Rubrics

### G7.C3.W1: Station 1 - Misconception Check (SEP: Constructing Explanations | DCI: PS1.B | CCC: Energy and Matter)
**Question:** Student A says: "When CO₂ absorbs energy, it breaks the bonds." Student B says: "The bonds don't break, they just vibrate." Who is correct and why?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies Student B + explains using bond energy concept + connects to Cycle 2 learning | "Student B is correct. The bonds don't break because breaking bonds requires MORE energy than IR radiation provides. From Cycle 2, we learned breaking bonds is endothermic - it absorbs energy. The IR energy just makes the bonds vibrate faster, which we can see in the simulation." |
| **3** | Correctly identifies Student B + explains using bond energy OR vibration concept | "Student B is correct because breaking bonds takes a lot of energy. The IR just makes the molecule shake." |
| **2** | Correctly identifies Student B but explanation incomplete or partially incorrect | "Student B is correct because CO₂ molecules vibrate when they absorb heat." |
| **1** | Incorrect identification OR correct identification with incorrect reasoning | "Student A is correct because energy breaks things apart." |
| **0** | No response OR completely irrelevant | "I don't know" or blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 pattern: "Student A is correct because absorbing energy gives molecules enough energy to break" → Reveals persistent bond energy misconception
- Score 2 pattern: Correct answer but reasoning is circular ("vibrates because it vibrates") → Needs deeper probing

### G7.C3.W1: Station 2 - Mass Tracking Calculation
**Question:** A tree absorbs 48 lbs of CO₂ per year. How many pounds of carbon is that? (CO₂ is 27% carbon by mass)

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct answer (12.9-13.1 lbs) + shows clear work | "48 × 0.27 = 12.96 lbs of carbon" |
| **3** | Correct answer but work unclear OR minor rounding error (12.5-13.5) | "About 13 lbs" with partial work shown |
| **2** | Correct setup but calculation error | "48 × 27 = 1296" (forgot to convert percentage) |
| **1** | Incorrect setup or major conceptual error | "48 - 27 = 21 lbs" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Multiplying by 27 instead of 0.27 → Remediate: review percentage conversion
- Subtracting instead of multiplying → Remediate: review "of" means multiply

### G7.C3.W1: Station 2 - Conservation Check (SEP: Engaging in Argument | DCI: PS1.B | CCC: Energy and Matter)
**Question:** A student says "When we burn fossil fuels, we're creating new carbon that goes into the atmosphere." Is this correct?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly refutes + explicitly invokes conservation of mass + explains where carbon actually comes from | "This is incorrect because of conservation of mass - atoms can't be created or destroyed. The carbon in fossil fuels was already there (from ancient plants/animals). Burning just releases it from its stored form back into the atmosphere as CO₂." |
| **3** | Correctly refutes + mentions conservation of mass OR explains carbon origin | "No, we're not creating carbon. The carbon was already in the fossil fuel from millions of years ago." |
| **2** | Correctly refutes but explanation incomplete | "No, we can't create atoms." |
| **1** | Incorrect or partially correct with major errors | "Yes, burning creates new carbon because fire makes things." |
| **0** | No response or irrelevant | Blank |

### G7.C3.W1: Exit Ticket - Integration (3D Assessment: SEP 7 + DCI PS1.B/ESS3.D + CCC Energy and Matter)
**Question:** A company claims their product "destroys carbon pollution." Evaluate this claim.

**3D Scoring Breakdown:**
- SEP (Engaging in Argument from Evidence): Does response critique claim using evidence?
- DCI (Conservation of Mass + Human Impacts): Does response apply conservation principle correctly?
- CCC (Energy and Matter): Does response track matter flow through system?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response | 3D Check |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **4** | Refutes using conservation of mass + explains what likely happens instead + demonstrates understanding of carbon cycle | "This claim is scientifically impossible. Carbon can't be destroyed (conservation of mass). The product might convert carbon from one form to another (like capturing CO₂ and storing it), but the carbon atoms still exist. Claims of 'destroying' pollution are misleading." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC |
| **3** | Refutes using conservation of mass + partial explanation of alternatives | "They can't destroy carbon because atoms aren't destroyed in chemical reactions. They probably just move or store it somewhere else." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC |
| **2** | Recognizes claim is problematic but explanation weak | "I don't think you can destroy carbon pollution completely." | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC |
| **1** | Accepts claim or major misconceptions | "It's probably true if they have the right chemicals." | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC |
| **0** | No response | Blank | ✗all |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 pattern: "Strong chemicals can break down anything" → Mass destruction misconception; return to atom manipulatives
- Score 2 pattern: Correct intuition but can't articulate why → Provide sentence frames: "This is impossible because..."
- Score 3 pattern: Conservation correct but doesn't track WHERE carbon goes → Use carbon cycle diagram as scaffold

## Grade 8 Rubrics

### G8.C3.W1: Station 1 - Misconception Check (SEP: Analyzing Data | DCI: PS2.A | CCC: Cause and Effect)
**Question:** When a 50 kg cheetah contacts a 25 kg gazelle during a chase, compare the forces.
**Correct Answer:** c) Forces are equal

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies forces as EQUAL + explicitly invokes Newton's Third Law + may note different accelerations | "The forces are equal (Newton's Third Law: for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction). Even though the cheetah is bigger, both exert the same force on each other. The ACCELERATIONS are different though - the smaller gazelle accelerates more." |
| **3** | Correctly identifies forces as equal + mentions Newton's Third Law | "The forces are equal because of Newton's Third Law." |
| **2** | Correctly identifies forces as equal but no explanation OR incomplete | "They're the same force." |
| **1** | Incorrect - states larger animal exerts more force | "The cheetah exerts more force because it's bigger and stronger." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Answer (a) "Cheetah exerts more force" → MOST COMMON ERROR. Reveals conflation of force with size/strength. Remediate with paired object demonstrations.
- Answer (b) "Gazelle exerts more force" → Rare. May indicate random guessing or misreading.
- Answer (d) "Can't determine" → Student may be conflating force with acceleration or lacks confidence in N3L.

### G8.C3.W1: Station 1 - Calculation Verification
**Questions:** Newton's Third Law force (500N expected) and acceleration calculations.

| Score | Criteria | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **4** | All three correct: Force = 500N, Cheetah a = 10 m/s², Gazelle a = 20 m/s² | Full credit |
| **3** | Two of three correct OR all three with minor arithmetic errors | Partial credit |
| **2** | One correct OR correct setup with execution errors | Needs calculation support |
| **1** | Incorrect setup but some relevant physics vocabulary | Needs conceptual review |
| **0** | No response or completely incorrect | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Force ≠ 500N → Didn't apply N3L correctly; thinks forces can be unequal
- Cheetah acceleration > gazelle acceleration → Inverted the relationship; review a = F/m
- Acceleration in wrong units → Review dimensional analysis

### G8.C3.W1: Station 1 - Evolutionary Insight (SEP: Constructing Explanations | DCI: LS4.B | CCC: Cause and Effect)
**Question:** Based on your calculations, why might being SMALLER give prey an advantage during predator contact?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Connects lower mass → higher acceleration + explains survival advantage + uses F=ma correctly | "From F=ma, if the force is equal but mass is smaller, acceleration is greater (a=F/m). So when a predator and prey collide, the smaller prey gets pushed away FASTER, which gives it more distance to escape. This is why many prey species evolved smaller sizes - it's a survival advantage." |
| **3** | Connects lower mass → higher acceleration + mentions survival | "Smaller animals accelerate faster when hit with the same force, so they can escape better." |
| **2** | Mentions acceleration or escape but connection incomplete | "Smaller is faster." |
| **1** | Incorrect reasoning | "Smaller animals can hide better." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### G8.C3.W1: Exit Ticket - Integration (3D Assessment: SEP 6 + DCI LS4.B + CCC Cause and Effect)
**Question:** Predict what will happen to brown/green insects over 100 generations with a new visual predator. Explain using both natural selection AND physics concepts.

**3D Scoring Breakdown:**
- SEP (Constructing Explanations): Does response include mechanism-based reasoning?
- DCI (Natural Selection): Does response correctly apply selection → trait frequency change?
- CCC (Cause and Effect): Does response identify causal chain from environment → selection → population change?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response | 3D Check |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **4** | Correct prediction + natural selection mechanism + physics connection (e.g., force, acceleration, energy) + quantitative reasoning | "Over 100 generations, the better-camouflaged color (whichever matches the tree bark) will increase in frequency. Predators exert 'selection pressure' - like a force that pushes the population toward certain traits. Insects that blend in survive to reproduce more. If brown matches bark, brown might go from 50% to 90%+. Physics: When caught, smaller/faster insects (higher a=F/m) might still escape, so speed traits might also be selected for." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC |
| **3** | Correct prediction + natural selection mechanism + physics connection (but weaker integration) | "The color that blends in will become more common because predators catch the visible ones. It's like a force selecting for certain traits." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC |
| **2** | Correct prediction + natural selection OR physics (not both) | "Green insects will die more if the tree is brown, so brown will become more common." | ~SEP ✓DCI ✗CCC |
| **1** | Correct prediction but no mechanism OR incorrect prediction | "They'll all turn brown eventually." (Lamarckian misconception) | ✗SEP ~DCI ✗CCC |
| **0** | No response | Blank | ✗all |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 Lamarckian pattern: "Insects will change their color to survive" → Individual adaptation misconception; emphasize POPULATION change
- Score 2 physics-only: Focus on escape mechanics without trait inheritance → Connect physics TO inheritance
- Score 3 analogy-only: Uses "force" metaphor but doesn't quantify → Push for numerical prediction

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | All 4 blanks correct + can explain WHY each step follows | "decreases, increases, increases, melts - because dark water absorbs more than white ice, heating the water, which melts more ice" |
| **3** | All 4 blanks correct OR 3 correct with explanation | "decreases, increases, increases, melts" |
| **2** | 2-3 blanks correct | "decreases, increases, stays same, melts" |
| **1** | 1 blank correct or logic reversed | "increases, decreases, decreases, freezes" |
| **0** | No response or all incorrect | Blank |

### G7.C3.W2: Station 2 - pH Calculation
**Question:** If ocean pH dropped 0.1 over 50 years, how long until it drops another 0.15?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct answer (75 years) + clear work + units | "Rate = 0.1/50 = 0.002 per year. Time = 0.15/0.002 = 75 years" |
| **3** | Correct answer with partial work OR correct method with arithmetic error | "75 years" or "0.15 ÷ 0.002 = 70 years" |
| **2** | Correct rate calculation but wrong final answer | "0.002 per year, so... 50 years?" |
| **1** | Attempt at calculation with conceptual error | "0.1 + 0.15 = 0.25 years" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### G7.C3.W2: Exit Ticket - Integration (3D: SEP 7 + DCI ESS3.D + CCC Stability and Change)
**Question:** Evaluate the proposal to paint roofs white to combat climate change.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response | 3D Check |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **4** | Evaluates using albedo + acknowledges limitations + connects to carbon cycle | "White roofs would increase albedo, reflecting more sunlight and reducing absorption. This could lower local temperatures and reduce AC energy use (which reduces CO₂ emissions). However, it doesn't remove existing CO₂ - it only reduces warming slightly. It's a partial solution, not a fix for the carbon cycle imbalance." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC |
| **3** | Evaluates using albedo + partial connection to bigger picture | "White roofs reflect sunlight so buildings stay cooler. This is good because less energy is absorbed. But it won't fix climate change completely." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC |
| **2** | Correct albedo reasoning but no connection to larger systems | "White reflects, so roofs would be cooler." | ~SEP ✓DCI ✗CCC |
| **1** | Opinion without scientific reasoning | "I think it's a good idea because white is cooler." | ✗SEP ~DCI ✗CCC |
| **0** | No response | Blank | ✗all |

## Grade 8 Week 2 Rubrics

### G8.C3.W2: Station 1 - Homologous Structures Reasoning
**Question:** Which is more likely - independent evolution or common ancestor? Explain.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct answer (common ancestor) + parsimony reasoning + evidence cited | "Common ancestor is more likely. It's simpler to explain one origin with modifications than 4 separate origins of the same bone pattern. The similarities are too specific to be coincidence." |
| **3** | Correct answer + basic reasoning | "Common ancestor, because it's unlikely 4 different animals would evolve the same bones by chance." |
| **2** | Correct answer but weak or no reasoning | "Common ancestor." |
| **1** | Incorrect answer OR correct answer with incorrect reasoning | "Independent evolution because they live in different environments." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### G8.C3.W2: Station 2 - Rate of Change Calculation
**Question:** Calculate average rate of leg length change over 55 million years.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct answer (0.73 cm/My) + clear work + units | "(60-20)/55 = 40/55 = 0.73 cm per million years" |
| **3** | Correct method with minor arithmetic error OR correct answer without units | "40/55 = 0.7 cm" |
| **2** | Correct setup but wrong execution | "60-20 = 40... 40 × 55 = 2200" |
| **1** | Attempt with conceptual error | "60/55 = 1.09" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### G8.C3.W2: Exit Ticket - Integration (3D: SEP 6 + DCI LS4.B/PS2.A + CCC Cause and Effect)
**Question:** Predict how a mouse population might change as habitat gets colder over thousands of years.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response | 3D Check |
|-------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **4** | Correct prediction + natural selection mechanism + physics/energy reasoning + multiple traits considered | "Mice with larger body size would be selected for because larger bodies have lower surface area to volume ratio, meaning less heat loss (physics). Thicker fur would also be selected for as insulation. Metabolic rate might increase to generate more internal heat. Over thousands of years, the population would shift toward these 'cold-adapted' traits as individuals with them survive and reproduce more." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC |
| **3** | Correct prediction + natural selection + physics OR multiple traits (not all three) | "Bigger mice would survive better because they lose less heat. Natural selection would favor larger individuals over time." | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC |
| **2** | Correct prediction + one mechanism (natural selection OR physics) | "Mice would get bigger fur to stay warm." | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC |
| **1** | Prediction without mechanism OR Lamarckian reasoning | "The mice would grow thicker fur because they're cold." | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC |
| **0** | No response | Blank | ✗all |

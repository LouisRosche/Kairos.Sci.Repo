# KAMS Science Standards Alignment
## NGSS Mapping Across Cycles 1-8 (SY25-26)
## Version 3.0 | December 2025

---

## Overview

This document maps all Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) coverage across the KAMS Science curriculum for Grades 7 and 8, grounded in the *Scholarly Foundations for NGSS-Aligned Middle School Science Curriculum Development*. Each cycle targets specific Performance Expectations while spiraling previously taught standards.

> **Calendar Alignment Note (Dec 2025):** SY25-26 supports Cycles 1-8 (38 instructional weeks). Cycle 1 (8 weeks) establishes foundational Life Science (G7) and Physical Science (G8) standards. Cycle 2 is legacy pre-architecture content. MS-ESS1-2 (G7) and MS-ETS1-2 (G8) from deferred C9 are integrated as secondary standards in Cycle 8. Year-End Integration (C10) is merged into Cycle 8 Week 4.

## Research Foundation: Phenomenon-Based Three-Dimensional Learning

### Storyline-Driven Curriculum (OpenSciEd Model)

Brian Reiser's Northwestern team established that anchoring phenomena must drive authentic student questioning—not serve as mere "hooks." Our curriculum follows Reiser et al.'s (2021) **five instructional routines**:

1. **Eliciting Questions from Phenomena:** Begin with puzzling, student-relevant phenomena requiring 3D explanation
2. **Navigating Investigations Collaboratively:** Students co-construct investigation pathways
3. **Problematizing to Identify Knowledge Gaps:** Surface what students don't yet understand
4. **Putting Pieces Together for Synthesis:** Connect observations to underlying concepts
5. **Anchoring Phenomenon Revisits:** Return to the phenomenon with deeper understanding

### Crosscutting Concepts as Equity Entry Points

Research establishes CCCs as "complementary lenses on phenomena" that leverage students' **funds of knowledge** from homes and communities (Nordine & Lee, 2021). CCCs serve as entry points for historically marginalized students because students already use CCC-like thinking in everyday reasoning (Lee, Miller, & Januszyk, 2014).

| CCC | Everyday Reasoning Connection | Curriculum Application |
|-----|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Patterns** | Noticing regularities in daily life | Weather patterns, trait inheritance |
| **Cause and Effect** | "Why did that happen?" | Climate drivers, natural selection |
| **Scale and Proportion** | Relative sizes, quantities | Geologic time, molecular scale |
| **Systems and Models** | How things work together | Ecosystems, weather systems |
| **Energy and Matter** | What things are made of | Energy flow, matter cycling |
| **Structure and Function** | "What is it for?" | Adaptations, homologous structures |
| **Stability and Change** | "Will it stay the same?" | Equilibrium, tipping points |

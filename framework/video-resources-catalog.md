## Overview

This catalog documents high-quality video resources for async alternatives in student-page.html files. When students cannot access hands-on materials at home, these videos provide equivalent conceptual coverage.

**Usage Priority:**
1. Use videos from verified educational sources only
2. Prefer videos under 10 minutes for middle school attention spans
3. Ensure videos are HTTPS-accessible (required for Canvas LMS)
4. Check videos annually for availability

# KAMS Cycle 3 Pedagogical Framework: "Weaponizing the Gaps"
## December 1-19, 2025 | Research Foundation & Methodology

---

## Executive Summary

This curriculum implements **strategic interleaving** (Rohrer, 2012) to remediate Cycle 2 misconceptions while advancing pacing. Rather than explicit re-teaching, Cycle 3 content creates contexts where:

1. Incorrect mental models generate visible cognitive dissonance
2. Successful task completion requires retrieval of Cycle 2 concepts
3. Transfer is assessed through novel phenomena, not repeated prompts

**Research Foundation:**
- Rohrer (2012): Interleaving forces discrimination between similar concepts
- Roediger & Karpicke (2006): Retrieval practice > re-study for retention
- Smithsonian Science (2024): Three-dimensional assessment requires integrated SEP-DCI-CCC tasks

## 3-Dimensional Learning Framework

### Science and Engineering Practices (SEP)
Each station targets specific practices:
- **SEP 1:** Asking Questions and Defining Problems
- **SEP 4:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data
- **SEP 6:** Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
- **SEP 7:** Engaging in Argument from Evidence

### Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI)
Grade-specific progressions building on Cycle 2 foundations while introducing new content.

### Crosscutting Concepts (CCC)
- **Cause and Effect:** Mechanism-based reasoning
- **Energy and Matter:** Conservation and flow through systems
- **Stability and Change:** Equilibrium and feedback loops

## Station-Based Learning Model

> **Note for Remote/Async Learners:** The term "station" refers to **timed learning segments** that scholars complete sequentially, NOT physical locations. Whether in-class or at home, scholars work through each station in order on their Chromebook. All materials are embedded in the student page — no physical setup required for remote learners.

### Structure
Each week follows a consistent station rotation:
1. **Hook (Day 1):** Phenomenon-driven engagement, prior knowledge activation
2. **Station 1 (Day 1):** Core concept with interleaved retrieval
3. **Station 2 (Day 1):** Application with physical manipulatives
4. **Station 3 (Day 2):** Engineering design challenge
5. **Exit Ticket (Day 3):** Mixed assessment (new + spiral + integration)

### Timing
- Long periods (65 min): Hook + 2 stations + break
- Short periods (45 min): Single station focus
- Exit periods (65 min): Assessment + catch-up/extension

### Pomodoro Integration
- 25-minute focused station work
- 5-minute movement/social break between stations
- Clear visual timer
- Break activities: stretch, quick walk, drink water

## Assessment Architecture

### Formative Assessment (Embedded in Stations)
Each station includes:
1. **Entry checkpoint:** Quick retrieval question from previous cycle
2. **Process monitoring:** Teacher observation protocol with checklist
3. **Exit checkpoint:** Application question combining old + new concepts

### Exit Ticket Structure (Every Week)
| Component | Count | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| NEW content | 2 | Cycle 3 learning targets |
| SPIRAL content | 2 | Cycle 2 retrieval practice |
| INTEGRATION | 1 | Requires both cycles |
| SEP-1 Question Generator | 1 | Student-generated HOW/WHY questions |

**Format:** Google Forms → Auto-sync to Canvas

### Point Distribution (Per Week = 100 pts)
| Component | Points | Grading Type |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Hook | 12 | Mixed (auto + manual) |
| Station 1 | 20 | Mixed |
| Station 2 | 20 | Mixed |
| Station 3 | 25 | Mostly manual (design) |
| Exit Ticket | 23 | Mixed |

## Misconception-Targeted Design

### Philosophy: "Weaponizing the Gaps"
Rather than re-teaching Cycle 2 content directly, we:
1. Design tasks where misconceptions cause visible failures
2. Create "misconception traps" with explicit distractors
3. Use immediate feedback to trigger cognitive revision
4. Spiral key concepts in novel contexts

### Implementation
- **Distractor Analysis:** Each MCQ includes common misconceptions as options
- **Explicit Labeling:** Questions tagged as (NEW), (SPIRAL), or (INTEGRATION)
- **Feedback Design:** Incorrect responses get targeted remediation text
- **Rubric Precision:** Observable behaviors, not subjective judgments

## Differentiation Framework

### Universal Design Features (All Materials)
- Chunked instructions (numbered steps, one action per line)
- Visual supports for all abstract concepts
- Multiple means of expression (verbal, written, drawn, recorded)
- Extended time built into asynchronous model

### Tiered Accommodations

| Accommodation | Implementation |
|--------------|----------------|
| Extended time | Async model allows unlimited time; no time-based penalties |
| Reduced questions | Mark "required" questions; others optional |
| Text-to-speech | Google Forms compatible with screen readers |
| Simplified language | Vocabulary glossary QR code (accessible on student page) |
| Graphic organizers | Blank cause-effect diagrams, calculation templates |
| Frequent breaks | Pomodoro structure (25 on/5 off) |
| Calculator use | Permitted for all calculation questions |
| Word bank | Provided for constructed responses |

### ELL Supports
- Bilingual glossary (Spanish available)
- Sentence frames: "The evidence shows... because..."
- Partner reading protocol for dense text
- Visual-heavy phenomena (videos, simulations over text)

### Extension Opportunities
- Challenge problems marked with star
- "Design your own phenomenon" option
- Peer teaching opportunities
- Connection to current research articles

## Recovery Path Design

### Asynchronous Completion Options
Students who miss live instruction can:
1. Access video walkthroughs of each station (linked in Canvas)
2. Complete station tasks independently on Chromebook
3. Submit at any point during the cycle (forgiving grading policy)

### Just-in-Time Support
- Each station includes "Stuck? Start Here" section
- QR codes link to 2-minute concept refreshers
- Peer pairing protocol for collaborative support

---

## Teacher Facilitation Guidelines

### During Stations
- Circulate with clipboard using observation protocol
- Ask probing questions when misconceptions appear
- Flag students for 1:1 follow-up if needed
- Use "strategic pausing" to address whole-class patterns

### Misconception Response Protocol
1. **Identify:** Notice incorrect reasoning in student work
2. **Probe:** Ask clarifying question (don't immediately correct)
3. **Redirect:** Point to evidence/simulation that contradicts misconception
4. **Confirm:** Have student articulate revised understanding

### Chromebook Management
- All materials accessible via Canvas modules
- Offline-capable Google Forms
- Station rotation timer displayed on board
- Emergency paper backups available

---

## Technical Integration

### Platform Stack
- **LMS:** Canvas (modules, assignments, gradebook)
- **Assessment:** Google Forms (embedded via LTI)
- **Data Hub:** Google Sheets (IMPORTRANGE formulas)
- **Simulations:** PhET (browser-based, Chromebook-friendly)

### Data Flow
1. Students submit via Google Forms
2. Responses auto-populate linked spreadsheet
3. Hub aggregates across forms via IMPORTRANGE
4. Scores sync to Canvas gradebook

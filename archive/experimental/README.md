# Experimental/Archived Files

This directory contains files that were developed but are not currently integrated into the active codebase.

## Printables (Archived December 2025)

**Reason for archival:** These 9 HTML tools had zero references anywhere in the active codebase. They appear to be experimental classroom management tools that were never deployed.

### Files

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| index.html | Hub page for all printables | 544 |
| roster-manager.html | Class roster management tool | 697 |
| classroom-seating-map.html | Seating chart generator | 1046 |
| class-goal-tracker.html | Goal tracking system | 708 |
| peer-tutor-cards.html | Peer tutoring cards | 649 |
| seat-signin-card.html | Seating sign-in cards | 649 |
| seating-insights-report.html | Seating analytics report | 797 |
| signin-data-entry.html | Data entry form | 918 |
| station-rotation-poster.html | Station rotation guide | 555 |

### If You Want to Restore

These files are self-contained HTML tools. To restore:

1. Move the `printables/` directory back to `templates/printables/`
2. Add documentation to the main README
3. Link from appropriate curriculum pages if needed

### Note

These tools may still be useful for classroom management but need:
- Documentation on how to use them
- Integration with the seating data pipeline
- Testing and validation

## HTML Components (Archived December 2025)

**Reason for archival:** Component templates were never adopted in student pages. They use outdated v2.0 inline styles instead of the v3.0 CSS class pattern.

See `html-components/README.md` for details

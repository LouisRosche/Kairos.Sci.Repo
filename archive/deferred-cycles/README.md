# Deferred Cycles Archive

## Contents

- `cycle09.json` - Space/Engineering (Status: DEFERRED - standards integrated into C8)

## Resolution Details

## SY26-27 Planning

When re-activating these cycles:
1. Move config files back to `config/cycles/`
2. Create content directories under `content/grade{7,8}/`
3. Update `master-config.json` cycle range
4. Remove deferred status from JSON configs

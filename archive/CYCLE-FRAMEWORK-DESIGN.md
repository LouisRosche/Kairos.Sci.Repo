## 1. Calendar Context

### SY25-26 Academic Calendar

| Cycle | Dates | Duration | Notes |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| **C1** | Aug 18 - Oct 10, 2025 | 8 weeks | Extended intro period; Labor Day 9/1 |
| **C2** | Oct 20 - Nov 21, 2025 | 5 weeks | Legacy 4-week content; Thanksgiving 11/24-28 |
| **C3** | Dec 1 - Dec 19, 2025 | 3 weeks | **COMPLETE** |
| **C4** | Jan 6 - Feb 12, 2026 | 5.5 weeks | **COMPLETE**; MLK Day 1/19 |
| **C5** | Feb 23 - Mar 12, 2026 | 3 weeks | Placeholder → **DESIGN** |
| **C6** | Mar 24 - Apr 24, 2026 | 4.5 weeks | Placeholder → **DESIGN**; buffer built in |
| **C7** | Apr 27 - May 22, 2026 | 4 weeks | Placeholder → **DESIGN** |
| **C8** | Jun 1 - Jun 26, 2026 | 4 weeks | Placeholder → **DESIGN**; Juneteenth 6/19 |

### Key Insight: Cycle 1 Duration

Cycle 1 spans **8 weeks** (Aug 18 - Oct 10). This suggests:
- Intentionally extended for beginning-of-year onboarding
- Should establish foundational scientific practices
- Sets up spiral curriculum for entire year
- Likely includes assessment baselines and culture-building

**Recommendation:** Structure as 3 instructional weeks + 5 weeks of orientation, baseline assessment, and culture-building, OR as an extended 4-week foundational cycle.

## Validation Questions

Before proceeding to implementation, please confirm:

1. **Cycle 1 Structure:** Should C1 be the full 8-week foundational period, or condensed to 3 weeks with the remaining time for orientation?

2. **Cycle 2 Retrofit:** Approve compression from 4 weeks to 3 weeks?

3. **Topic Sequencing:** Are the phenomena and topics appropriate for each grade level?

4. **Spiral Connections:** Do the proposed spiral connections make pedagogical sense?

5. **Scope:** Build all cycles (C1, C2-retrofit, C5-C8), or prioritize specific cycles?

# KAMS Cycle 3 Curriculum Design: "Weaponizing the Gaps"
## December 1-19, 2025 | 3 Weeks Before Winter Break

---

## Executive Summary

This curriculum design implements **strategic interleaving** (Rohrer, 2012) to remediate Cycle 2 misconceptions while advancing pacing. Rather than explicit re-teaching, Cycle 3 content creates contexts where:
1. Incorrect mental models generate visible cognitive dissonance
2. Successful task completion requires retrieval of Cycle 2 concepts
3. Transfer is assessed through novel phenomena, not repeated prompts

**Research Foundation:**
- Rohrer (2012): Interleaving forces discrimination between similar concepts
- Roediger & Karpicke (2006): Retrieval practice > re-study for retention
- Smithsonian Science (2024): Three-dimensional assessment requires integrated SEP-DCI-CCC tasks

## Grade 7: Climate Change & Energy Flow
### MS-ESS3-5 + Spiral to MS-PS1-5, MS-PS1-6

### Week 1: The Greenhouse Effect Mystery
**Phenomenon:** "Why does a car get hot inside but not outside?"

**NGSS Performance Expectation:** MS-ESS3-5
> Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past century.

**3D Integration:**
- **DCI:** ESS3.D (Human impacts on Earth systems)
- **SEP:** Asking Questions and Defining Problems
- **CCC:** Cause and Effect; Energy and Matter

#### Station 1: Molecular Vibration & Bond Energy (INTERLEAVED RETRIEVAL)
**Spiral Target:** Students MUST correctly apply bond energy concepts to explain IR absorption
**Resource:** PhET "Molecules and Light" simulation (https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/molecules-and-light)

**Task:** Analyze PhET simulation showing CO₂ molecules absorbing infrared radiation
- WHY does CO₂ absorb IR but not N₂?
- Draw molecular model showing energy transfer
- **CRITICAL:** "When IR energy is absorbed, do the bonds in CO₂ break or just vibrate faster?"

**Misconception Trap:** Students who believe "breaking bonds releases energy" will incorrectly predict CO₂ breaks apart. The simulation shows molecules vibrating, NOT breaking—forcing conceptual revision.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Correctly identify that bonds ABSORB energy to vibrate
2. Explain that breaking would REQUIRE more energy than IR provides
3. Connect to Cycle 2: Endothermic processes absorb energy

#### Station 2: Carbon Cycle Conservation (INTERLEAVED RETRIEVAL)
**Spiral Target:** Conservation of mass in Earth systems

**Task:** Trace carbon atoms through photosynthesis → respiration → combustion → atmosphere
- Use manipulatives to physically move "carbon atoms" through cycle
- Balance each transformation (atoms in = atoms out)
- Calculate: If 1 tree absorbs 48 lbs CO₂/year, how many carbon atoms is that?

**Misconception Trap:** Students who believe mass disappears will struggle to balance the cycle. Physical atom manipulatives make conservation visible.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Demonstrate conservation through all cycle steps
2. Connect to Cycle 2: Chemical reactions rearrange, don't destroy atoms
3. Quantify carbon storage in different reservoirs

#### Station 3: Engineering Challenge—Design a Thermal Trap
**Spiral Target:** Apply thermal energy concepts to solve problems

**Task:** Design and model a structure that maximizes heat retention
- Given constraints: 3 materials, limited surface area
- Must explain WHY each material choice affects thermal energy flow
- **INTERLEAVED:** Connect to Cycle 2 energy concepts—which materials absorb more thermal energy? Which conduct heat faster?

**Success Criteria:**
1. Evidence-based material selection using thermal properties
2. Correct explanation of heat trapping mechanism (absorption, conduction, radiation)
3. Connection to molecular-level energy storage (particles moving faster = higher temperature)

## Grade 8: Natural Selection & Forces in Nature
### MS-LS4-4, MS-LS4-6 + Spiral to MS-PS2-1, MS-PS2-2

### Week 1: The Cheetah-Gazelle Arms Race
**Phenomenon:** "If cheetahs are the fastest land animal, why haven't gazelles gone extinct?"

**NGSS Performance Expectation:** MS-LS4-4
> Construct an explanation based on evidence that describes how genetic variations of traits in a population increase some individuals' probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific environment.

**3D Integration:**
- **DCI:** LS4.B (Natural Selection)
- **SEP:** Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
- **CCC:** Cause and Effect; Stability and Change

#### Station 1: Predator-Prey Force Analysis (INTERLEAVED RETRIEVAL)
**Spiral Target:** Newton's Third Law in biological systems

**Task:** Analyze slow-motion video of cheetah-gazelle chase, focusing on the moment of contact/collision
- Identify action-reaction force pairs when cheetah strikes gazelle
- Calculate relative accelerations using F=ma during collision
- **CRITICAL QUESTION:** "When the cheetah's body contacts the gazelle's body, does the cheetah exert more force on the gazelle, or do they exert equal forces on each other?"

**Misconception Trap:** Students who believe "larger animals exert more force" will predict the cheetah exerts greater force. Newton's Third Law requires equal and opposite forces during ANY contact—the 50kg cheetah and 25kg gazelle exert EQUAL forces on each other, but experience DIFFERENT accelerations.

**Data Analysis (Collision Scenario):**
- During a 0.2-second collision, cheetah (50 kg) and gazelle (25 kg) exert forces on each other
- Measured: Gazelle accelerates at 20 m/s² away from cheetah
- Calculate force on gazelle: F = ma = 25 kg × 20 m/s² = 500 N
- **KEY:** If forces are equal (Newton's Third Law), what force does the gazelle exert ON the cheetah? (Answer: 500 N)
- What is the cheetah's acceleration? a = F/m = 500 N / 50 kg = 10 m/s²

2. Calculate change in trait frequency over generations
3. Connect to forces: Selection pressure pushes population toward certain traits

#### Station 3: Engineering Challenge—Design a Survivor
**Spiral Target:** Apply force concepts to biological design

**Task:** Design an organism to survive a specific predation pressure
- Given constraints: mass budget, energy budget, habitat parameters
- Must justify design using force relationships (F=ma, momentum)

### Grade 8 Week 2 Forms

#### G8.C3.W2: Hook - Whale Flipper Mystery
**[Questions for Google Form]**

1. **Pre-assessment (retrieval)**
   - From Week 1: How does natural selection lead to changes in trait frequency?
   - [Short answer]

2. **Phenomenon engagement**
   - Whale flippers, bat wings, and human arms all have similar bone structures (humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, phalanges). Why would such different animals have similar bones?
   - [Short answer]

3. **Initial hypothesis**
   - What might explain these similarities?
   - [Multiple choice: a) Coincidence b) Same creator designed them c) They evolved from a common ancestor d) They developed the same solution independently]

4. **Connect to physics**
   - How might bone structure affect the forces an organism can exert? (Think about lever arms)
   - [Short answer]

5. **Confidence rating**
   - [Scale 1-5]

#### G8.C3.W2: Station 1 - Homologous Structures Analysis
**[Questions for Google Form]**
**Resource:** Comparative anatomy diagrams (whale, bat, human, horse forelimbs)

1. **Observation**
   - Identify and label the corresponding bones in each organism: humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, phalanges.
   - [Diagram labeling or short answer]

2. **Pattern analysis**
   - What similarities do you observe? What differences?
   - [Short answer]

3. **CRITICAL EVOLUTIONARY REASONING**
   - Which is more likely: (A) These structures evolved independently 4 times to look similar, OR (B) These structures were inherited from a common ancestor and modified. Explain your reasoning.
   - [Short answer - REQUIRED]
   - **ANSWER KEY:** B is more likely. It's more parsimonious - one origin with modification is simpler than 4 independent origins of the same pattern.

4. **Force analysis (INTERLEAVED)**
   - A whale flipper is shorter and wider than a bat wing. How does this affect the force it can exert on water vs. air? Use F=ma reasoning.
   - [Short answer]
   - **ANSWER KEY:** Shorter lever arm means less distance but more force can be applied. Water is denser than air, so whale needs higher force (which short, wide flipper provides) while bat needs speed (which long, thin wing provides).

5. **Evolutionary insight**
   - Why might natural selection favor different modifications of the same basic structure in different environments?
   - [Short answer]

#### G8.C3.W2: Station 2 - Fossil Record Investigation
**[Questions for Google Form]**
**Resource:** Horse evolution fossil series (Hyracotherium → Mesohippus → Merychippus → Equus)

   - [Data table]

2. **Trend analysis**
   - Graph leg bone length over time. Describe the trend.
   - [Short answer + sketch/upload]

3. **Calculation (INTERLEAVED)**
   - If leg length increased from 20cm to 60cm over 55 million years, what is the average rate of change per million years?
   - [Calculation]
   - **ANSWER KEY:** (60-20)/55 = 40/55 = 0.73 cm per million years

4. **Speed connection**
   - Longer legs allow for longer strides. If stride length tripled and stride frequency stayed the same, how would speed change? (speed = stride length × frequency)
   - [Calculation + explain]
   - **ANSWER KEY:** Speed would triple (3× stride length × 1× frequency = 3× speed)

5. **Environmental context**
   - Horse ancestors lived in forests; modern horses live in grasslands. How might this environmental change have driven the evolution of longer legs?
   - [Short answer]
   - **ANSWER KEY:** Grasslands have fewer hiding places, so speed becomes essential for escape. Natural selection favored individuals with longer legs who could run faster from predators.

   - [Short answer]

3. **(SPIRAL - C2)** A polar bear (400 kg) pushes off ice to swim. If it accelerates at 2 m/s², what force does the ice exert back on the bear?
   - [Calculation]
   - **ANSWER KEY:** F = ma = 400 × 2 = 800 N. By N3L, ice exerts 800 N on bear.

4. **(SPIRAL - C2)** Two animals collide: a 200 kg seal and a 400 kg walrus. Compare the forces they exert on each other.
   - [Multiple choice + explain]
   - **ANSWER KEY:** Forces are equal (Newton's Third Law), but seal experiences greater acceleration.

5. **(INTEGRATION)** A population of mice lives in a habitat that is gradually getting colder over thousands of years. Using natural selection AND physics concepts, predict how the population might change. Consider body size, fur thickness, and metabolic rate.

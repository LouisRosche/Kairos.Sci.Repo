## Real-Time Monitoring

### During Stations: Clipboard Checklist

**Grade 7 - Watch For:**
| Misconception | Student Response | Intervention |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| "CO₂ breaks apart when absorbing IR" | Ask: "Is the molecule in pieces or shaking?" | Point to simulation; emphasize vibration |
| "Burning destroys carbon" | Ask: "Where did the carbon atoms go?" | Use manipulatives to trace atoms |
| "Dark colors are hotter" | Ask: "Why? What's happening at particle level?" | Connect to absorption, not inherent temperature |

**Grade 8 - Watch For:**
| Misconception | Student Response | Intervention |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| "Cheetah exerts more force" | Ask: "What does N3L say?" | Write F₁ = -F₂; have them explain |
| "Individual beans changed color" | Ask: "Did any single bean change?" | Emphasize population vs individual |
| "Bigger is always better for survival" | Ask: "What about acceleration?" | Return to a = F/m calculation |

### End of Each Day: Quick Data Check

1. Open Google Forms response summary
2. Check completion rate (target: >80%)
3. Scan short-answer responses for misconception patterns
4. Flag students with 0 submissions for follow-up

---

## Differentiation Quick-Reference

### Students Needing More Support
- Pair with stronger partner for station work
- Provide sentence frames: "The evidence shows ___ because ___"
- Allow verbal responses recorded on phone
- Extend time (async completion by end of cycle)

### Students Needing Challenge
- "Explain to a 5th grader why CO₂ traps heat"
- "Design a second organism that competes with your first"
- "Calculate exact pH change over 100 years using rate"

### ELL Students
- Provide vocabulary glossary (terms: absorb, vibrate, conserve, selection pressure, trait, acceleration)
- Partner with bilingual peer when possible
- Accept diagrams as partial credit for explanations

---

## End-of-Week Checklist

### Friday Afternoon (15 min)

- [ ] Export all form responses to spreadsheets
- [ ] Run IMPORTRANGE formulas in hub to pull scores
- [ ] Sync scores to Canvas gradebook
- [ ] Review Exit Ticket data for both grades
- [ ] Identify students with <50% completion → Monday follow-up
- [ ] Note misconception patterns for Week 2 emphasis
- [ ] Prep Week 2 materials (albedo surfaces for G7, fossils for G8)

### Gradebook Sync Steps

1. Open hub spreadsheet
2. Navigate to `7th.C3.FormResponses` / `8th.C3.FormResponses` tabs
3. Verify IMPORTRANGE is pulling new data
4. Check `Sync Tracker` for any errors
5. In Canvas: Gradebook → Import → Select hub export
6. Verify scores appear correctly

## Emergency Backup Plans

### If Chromebooks fail:
- Print Station 1 simulation screenshots with questions
- Station 2 works without tech (manipulatives only)
- Station 3 works without tech (design on paper)
- Exit Ticket: Paper version in emergency folder

### If internet is down:
- PhET simulations can run offline if pre-downloaded
- Bean simulation requires no internet
- Have paper forms ready in emergency folder

### If time runs short:
- Priority: Hook + Station 1 + Exit Ticket
- Station 2 & 3 can be completed asynchronously
- Never skip Exit Ticket (essential data)

## Key Answer Keys (Teacher Reference)

### Grade 7
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| CO₂ mass calculation | 48 lbs × 0.27 = 13 lbs carbon |
| Photosynthesis atoms | Same on both sides (36 atoms) |
| Bond energy misconception | Student B correct - bonds vibrate, don't break |

### Grade 8
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| N3L force comparison | Forces are EQUAL (500 N each) |
| Cheetah acceleration | 500N ÷ 50kg = 10 m/s² |
| Gazelle acceleration | 500N ÷ 25kg = 20 m/s² |
| F=ma exit ticket | 20N ÷ 4kg = 5 m/s² |
| Survival calculation | 720 fast ÷ 820 total = 88% fast |

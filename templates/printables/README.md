# Printables - Archived

**Status:** MOVED TO `archive/experimental/printables/`
**Archived:** December 2025

## What Happened

The printables HTML tools (9 standalone browser applications for classroom management) were archived due to having no active references in the curriculum system.

## Current Location

All printables are now at: `archive/experimental/printables/`

See `archive/experimental/README.md` for the full list of files and restoration instructions.

## If You Need These Tools

The tools are still functional. To use them:

1. Navigate to `archive/experimental/printables/`
2. Open any `.html` file directly in a browser
3. Tools run entirely client-side, no server needed

# Printables - Classroom Management Tools

**Status:** EXPERIMENTAL / UNDOCUMENTED
**Last Reviewed:** December 2025

## Overview

This directory contains classroom management HTML tools that were developed for teacher use. These tools are **standalone HTML applications** that run entirely in the browser - no server required.

## Current Status

These tools exist but are **not actively referenced** in the main curriculum system. They may be useful for:
- Classroom setup and organization
- Student data visualization
- Seating arrangement planning
- Progress tracking

## Available Tools

| Tool | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Index** | `index.html` | Hub page linking to all tools |
| **Roster Manager** | `roster-manager.html` | Class roster management |
| **Seating Map** | `classroom-seating-map.html` | Visual seating chart generator |
| **Goal Tracker** | `class-goal-tracker.html` | Class goal tracking |
| **Peer Tutor Cards** | `peer-tutor-cards.html` | Generate peer tutoring cards |
| **Sign-in Cards** | `seat-signin-card.html` | Student sign-in cards |
| **Seating Insights** | `seating-insights-report.html` | Seating analytics report |
| **Data Entry** | `signin-data-entry.html` | Sign-in data entry form |
| **Rotation Poster** | `station-rotation-poster.html` | Station rotation guide |

## Usage

1. Open any `.html` file directly in a web browser
2. No installation or server required
3. Data is stored locally in browser (localStorage)

## Integration Status

- **NOT integrated** with main curriculum system
- **NOT referenced** in student pages or lesson plans
- **NOT part** of automated workflows

## Recommendations (from Dec 2025 Audit)

Options for these tools:
1. **Document & Keep:** Add proper documentation, integrate with teacher resources
2. **Archive:** Move to `/archive/experimental/` if not needed
3. **Remove:** Delete if abandoned

Current decision: **Document & Keep** - Tools retained for potential teacher use pending feedback.

## Future Work

If these tools prove useful:
- Add documentation for each tool
- Create teacher guide for classroom setup
- Consider integration with Hub Gradebook
